For example, suppose you have a one-to-one relationship between the Employees and Employee Benefits tables. If an employee leaves the company and you remove them from your Employees table, the related employee record in the Employee Benefits table is removed, too. Sometimes enforcing referential integrity doesn’t make sense. For example, suppose you have a one-to-many relationship between Shippers and Orders. You delete a shipper, and that shipper maps to orders in the Orders table. Those orders become orphans, meaning that they still contain a Shipper ID, but the ID is no longer valid because the record that it references no longer exists.\\n Cascade Update Related Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       To make sure that data in related fields is updated in all the related tables, select this. For example, suppose you simply want to change the ID of a shipper. Setting this option ensures that the Shipper ID is updated—not just in the Shipper table but also in any other tables connected to it that also include that Shipper ID, such as the Orders table.\\nCascade Delete Related Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The decision to select this depends on whether you need to retain records in some tables even though they might be deleted from other tables. For example, suppose you delete a shipper. If this option is selected, Access deletes all records in all tables that reference that Shipper ID, including all orders (in the Orders table) shipped by that shipper. You only select this option if you are sure you want your order history deleted.', 'metadata': {'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\HTML\\\\page_3.html', 'url': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-the-name-manager-in-excel-4d8c4c2b-9f7d-44e3-a3b4-9f61bd5c64e4', 'type': 'table_summary', 'table_index': 0}, 'id': '4b5d3366-77ac-4167-83c1-bc623d2882b4_table_0'}\n",

Access Tables Creating tables Creating tables Introduction to tables Introduction to tables Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less Tables are essential objects in a database because they hold all the information or data. For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their supplier', 'r example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables in Access, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need. For an introduction to planning and designing a database, see Database design basics . In this article Overview Table and field properties Data Types Table relationships Keys Benefits of using relationships Overview A relational database like Access usually has several related tables. In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a ', \"h as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com . Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You \", \"istics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. You must set a field's data type when you create the field. You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the \", 'y your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon. Examples of automatic data type detection The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view. Top of Page Table relationships Although each table stores data about a different subject, tables in an Access database usually store data about subjects that are related to each other. For example, a database might contain: A customers table that lists your company’s customers and their addresses. A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item. An orders table that tracks customer orders. Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that', 'te relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common. For more information, see Guide to table relationships . Top of Page Keys Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys: Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first', 't, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key . Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table. The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID. To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field o', \"er with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order's customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table. 1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name. 2. A foreign key\\xa0— note the absence of the key icon. Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. To\", \"ead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. Top of Page Benefits of using relationships Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits: Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer's name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data. Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don't use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance. Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your t\", ' of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

Introduction to What-If Analysis Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel 2021 Excel 2021 for Mac Excel 2019 Excel 2019 for Mac Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less By using What-If Analysis tools in Excel, you can use several different sets of values in one or more formulas to explore all the various results. For example, you can do What-If', ' of values in one or more formulas to explore all the various results. For example, you can do What-If Analysis to build two budgets that each assumes a certain level of revenue. Or, you can specify a result that you want a formula to produce, and then determine what sets of values will produce that result. Excel provides several different tools to help you perform the type of analysis that fits your needs. Note that this is just an overview of those tools. There are links to help topics for each one specifically. Overview What-If Analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. Three kinds of What-If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios , Goal Seek , and Data Tables . Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine possible results. A Data Table works with only one or two variables, but it can accept many different values for those variables. A Scenario can have multiple variables, but it can only acc', 'many different values for those variables. A Scenario can have multiple variables, but it can only accommodate up to 32 values. Goal Seek works differently from Scenarios and Data Tables in that it takes a result and determines possible input values that produce that result. In addition to these three tools, you can install add-ins that help you perform What-If Analysis, such as the Solver add-in. The Solver add-in is similar to Goal Seek, but it can accommodate more variables. You can also create forecasts by using the fill handle and various commands that are built into Excel. For more advanced models, you can use the Analysis ToolPak add-in . Use scenarios to consider many different variables A Scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on a worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values on a worksheet and then switch to any of these new scenarios to view different results. For example, suppose you have two budget scenarios: a worst case and a best', 'to view different results. For example, suppose you have two budget scenarios: a worst case and a best case. You can use the Scenario Manager to create both scenarios on the same worksheet, and then switch between them. For each scenario, you specify the cells that change and the values to use for that scenario. When you switch between scenarios, the result cell changes to reflect the different changing cell values. 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell If several people have specific information in separate workbooks that you want to use in scenarios, you can collect those workbooks and merge their scenarios. After you have created or gathered all the scenarios that you need, you can create a Scenario Summary Report that incorporates information from those scenarios. A scenario report displays all the scenario information in one table on a new worksheet. Note: Scenario reports are not automatically recalculated. If you change the values of a scenario, those changes will not show u', \" not automatically recalculated. If you change the values of a scenario, those changes will not show up in an existing summary report. Instead, you must create a new summary report. Use Goal Seek to find out how to get a desired result If you know the result that you want from a formula, but you're not sure what input value the formula requires to get that result, you can use the Goal Seek feature. For example, suppose that you need to borrow some money. You know how much money you want, how long a period you want in which to pay off the loan, and how much you can afford to pay each month. You can use Goal Seek to determine what interest rate you must secure in order to meet your loan goal. Cells B1, B2, and B3 are the values for the loan amount, term length, and interest rate. Cell B4 displays the result of the formula =PMT(B3/12,B2,B1) . Note: Goal Seek works with only one variable input value. If you want to determine more than one input value, for example, the loan amount and the monthly payment amount fo\", 'to determine more than one input value, for example, the loan amount and the monthly payment amount for a loan, you should instead use the Solver add-in. For more information about the Solver add-in, see the section Prepare forecasts and advanced business models , and follow the links in the See Also section. Use Data Tables to see the effects of one or two variables on a formula If you have a formula that uses one or two variables, or multiple formulas that all use one common variable, you can use a Data Table to see all the outcomes in one place. Using Data Tables makes it easy to examine a range of possibilities at a glance. Because you focus on only one or two variables, results are easy to read and share in tabular form. If automatic recalculation is enabled for the workbook, the data in Data Tables immediately recalculates; as a result, you always have fresh data. Cell B3 contains the input value. Cells C3, C4, and C5 are values Excel substitutes based on the value entered in B3. A Data Table cannot acc', ' C3, C4, and C5 are values Excel substitutes based on the value entered in B3. A Data Table cannot accommodate more than two variables. If you want to analyze more than two variables, you can use Scenarios. Although it is limited to only one or two variables, a Data Table can use as many different variable values as you want. A Scenario can have a maximum of 32 different values, but you can create as many scenarios as you want. Prepare forecasts and advanced business models If you want to prepare forecasts, you can use Excel to automatically generate future values that are based on existing data, or to automatically generate extrapolated values that are based on linear trend or growth trend calculations. You can fill in a series of values that fit a simple linear trend or an exponential growth trend by using the fill handle or the Series command. To extend complex and nonlinear data, you can use worksheet functions or the regression analysis tool in the Analysis ToolPak Add-in. Although Goal Seek can accommod', 'ctions or the regression analysis tool in the Analysis ToolPak Add-in. Although Goal Seek can accommodate only one variable, you can project backward for more variables by using the Solver add-in . By using Solver, you can find an optimal value for a formula in one cell—called the target cell—on a worksheet. Solver works with a group of cells that are related to the formula in the target cell. Solver adjusts the values in the changing cells that you specify—called the adjustable cells—to produce the result that you specify from the target cell formula. You can apply constraints to restrict the values that Solver can use in the model, and the constraints can refer to other cells that affect the target cell formula. Need more help?

Less In PivotTables, you can use summary functions in value fields to combine values from the underlying source data', 'ables, you can use summary functions in value fields to combine values from the underlying source data. If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The PivotTable would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. Another way to calculate is to use Measures in Power Pivot, which you create using a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula. For more information, see Create a Measure in Power Pivot . About calculations Windows, Mac Web iPad \\ue70d PivotTables provide ways to calculate data. Learn about the calculation methods that are available, how calculations are affected by the type of source data, and how to use formulas in PivotTables and PivotCharts. Available calculation methods To calculate values in a PivotTable, you can use any or ', 'nd PivotCharts. Available calculation methods To calculate values in a PivotTable, you can use any or all of the following types of calculation methods: Summary functions in value fields The data in the values area summarize the underlying source data in the PivotTable. For example, the following source data: Produces the following PivotTables and PivotCharts. If you create a PivotChart from the data in a PivotTable, the values in that PivotChart reflect the calculations in the associated PivotTable report. In the PivotTable, the Month column field provides the items March and April . The Region row field provides the items North , South , East , and West . The value at the intersection of the April column and the North row is the total sales revenue from the records in the source data that have Month values of April and Region values of North . In a PivotChart, the Region field might be a category field that shows North , South , East , and West as categories. The Month field could be a series field that sho', ' shows North , South , East , and West as categories. The Month field could be a series field that shows the items March , April , and May as series represented in the legend. A Values field named Sum of Sales could contain data markers that represent the total revenue in each region for each month. For example, one data marker would represent, by its position on the vertical (value) axis, the total sales for April in the North region. To calculate the value fields, the following summary functions are available for all types of source data except Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) source data. Custom calculations A custom calculation shows values based on other items or cells in the data area. For example, you could display values in the Sum of Sales data field as a percentage of March sales, or as a running total of the items in the Month field. The following functions are available for custom calculations in value fields. Formulas If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that', 'in value fields. Formulas If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The report would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. How the type of source data affects calculations Calculations and options that are available in a report depend on whether the source data came from an OLAP database or a non-OLAP data source. Calculations based on OLAP source data For PivotTables that are created from OLAP cubes, the summarized values are precalculated on the OLAP server before Excel displays the results. You cannot change how these precalculated values are calculated in the PivotTable. For example, you cannot change the summary function that is used to calculate data fields or subtotals, or add calculated fields or calculated items. Al', \"n that is used to calculate data fields or subtotals, or add calculated fields or calculated items. Also, if the OLAP server provides calculated fields, known as calculated members, you will see these fields in the PivotTable Field List. You will also see any calculated fields and calculated items that are created by macros that were written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and stored in your workbook, but you won't be able to change these fields or items. If you need additional types of calculations, contact your OLAP database administrator. For OLAP source data, you can include or exclude the values for hidden items when calculating subtotals and grand totals. Calculations based on non-OLAP source data In PivotTables that are based on other types of external data or on worksheet data, Excel uses the Sum summary function to calculate value fields that contain numeric data, and the Count summary function to calculate data fields that contain text. You can choose a different summary function, such as, Av\", 'n to calculate data fields that contain text. You can choose a different summary function, such as, Average, Max, or Min, to further analyze and customize your data. You can also create your own formulas that use elements of the report or other worksheet data by creating a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Using formulas in PivotTables You can create formulas only in reports that are based on a non-OLAP source data. You cannot use formulas in reports that are based on an OLAP database. When you use formulas in PivotTables, you should know about the following formula syntax rules and formula behavior: PivotTable formula elements In formulas that you create for calculated fields and calculated items, you can use operators and expressions as you do in other worksheet formulas. You can use constants and refer to data from the report, but you cannot use cell references or defined names. You cannot use worksheet functions that require cell references or defined names as arguments, and you cannot', \"not use worksheet functions that require cell references or defined names as arguments, and you cannot use array functions. Field and item names Excel uses field and item names to identify those elements of a report in your formulas. In the following example, the data in range C3:C9 is using the field name Dairy . A calculated item in the Type field that estimates sales for a new product based on Dairy sales could use a formula such as =Dairy * 115% . Note: In a PivotChart, the field names are displayed in the PivotTable field list, and item names can be seen in each field drop-down list. Don't confuse these names with those you see in chart tips, which reflect series and data point names instead. Formulas operate on sum totals, not individual records Formulas for calculated fields operate on the sum of the underlying data for any fields in the formula. For example, the calculated field formula =Sales * 1.2 multiplies the sum of the sales for each type and region by 1.2; it does not multiply each individual s\", \"ultiplies the sum of the sales for each type and region by 1.2; it does not multiply each individual sale by 1.2 and then sum the multiplied amounts. Formulas for calculated items operate on the individual records. For example, the calculated item formula =Dairy *115% multiplies each individual sale of Dairy times 115%, after which the multiplied amounts are summarized together in the Values area. Spaces, numbers, and symbols in names In a name that includes more than one field, the fields can be in any order. In the example above, cells C6:D6 can be 'April North' or 'North April' . Use single quotation marks around names that are more than one word or that include numbers or symbols. Totals Formulas cannot refer to totals (such as, March Total , April Total , and Grand Total in the example). Field names in item references You can include the field name in a reference to an item. The item name must be in square brackets\\xa0— for example, Region[North] . Use this format to avoid #NAME? errors when two items in tw\", 're brackets\\xa0— for example, Region[North] . Use this format to avoid #NAME? errors when two items in two different fields in a report have the same name. For example, if a report has an item named Meat in the Type field and another item named Meat in the Category field, you can prevent #NAME? errors by referring to the items as Type[Meat] and Category[Meat] . Referring to items by position You can refer to an item by its position in the report as currently sorted and displayed. Type[1] is Dairy , and Type[2] is Seafood . The item referred to in this way can change whenever the positions of items change or different items are displayed or hidden. Hidden items are not counted in this index. You can use relative positions to refer to items. The positions are determined relative to the calculated item that contains the formula. If South is the current region, Region[-1] is North ; if North is the current region, Region[+1] is South . For example, a calculated item could use the formula =Region[-1] * 3% . If the po', 'egion[+1] is South . For example, a calculated item could use the formula =Region[-1] * 3% . If the position that you give is before the first item or after the last item in the field, the formula results in a #REF! error. Using formulas in PivotCharts To use formulas in a PivotChart, you create the formulas in the associated PivotTable, where you can see the individual values that make up your data, and then you can view the results graphically in the PivotChart. For example, the following PivotChart shows sales for each salesperson per region: To see what sales would look like if they were increased by 10 percent, you could create a calculated field in the associated PivotTable that uses a formula such as =Sales * 110% . The result immediately appears in the PivotChart, as shown in the following chart: To see a separate data marker for sales in the North region minus a transportation cost of 8 percent, you could create a calculated item in the Region field with a formula such as =North – (North * 8%) . The ', 'could create a calculated item in the Region field with a formula such as =North – (North * 8%) . The resulting chart would look like this: However, a calculated item that is created in the Salesperson field would appear as a series represented in the legend and appear in the chart as a data point in each category. Create formulas in a PivotTable Important: You cannot create formulas in a PivotTable that is connected to an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data source. Before you start, decide whether you want a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Use a calculated field when you want to use the data from another field in your formula. Use a calculated item when you want your formula to use data from one or more specific items within a field. For calculated items, you can enter different formulas cell by cell. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCounty has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. If you h', '.25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation.

This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . Edit a PivotTable formula Before you edit a formula, determine whether that formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. If the formula is in a calculated item, also determine whether the formula is the only one for the calculated item. For calculated items, you can edit individual formulas for specific cells of a calculated item. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCalc has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, y', 'or example, if a calculated item named OrangeCalc has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. Determine whether a formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . In the list of formulas, find the formula that you want to change listed under Calculated Field or Calculated Item. When there are multiple formulas for a calculated item, the default formula that was entered when the item was created has the calculated item name in column B. For additional formulas for a calculated item, column B contains both the calculated item name and the names of intersecting items. For example, you might have a default formula for a calculated item named MyItem , and another formula for this item identified as MyItem January Sales . In the PivotT', 'em named MyItem , and another formula for this item identified as MyItem January Sales . In the PivotTable, you would find this formula in the Sales cell for the MyItem row and January column. Continue by using one of the following editing methods. Edit a calculated field formula Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, select the calculated field for which you want to change the formula.

Tip: If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation. For more information, see Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas . Delete a PivotTable formula Note: Deleting a PivotTable formula removes it permanently. If you do not want to remove a formula permanently, you can hide the field or item instead by dragging it out of the PivotTable. Determine whether the formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. Calculated fields appear in the PivotTable Field List. Calculated items appear as items within other fields.

Less Sometimes you may want to review records from one Access table only if there are corresponding records in another Access table that contain one or more fields with matching data. For example, you may want to review the employee records of employees who have processed at least one order to determine which employees are eligible for a bonus. Or, you may want to review contact information for customers who live in the same city as an employee so that you can match employees with a customers for in-person meetings. When you want to compare two Access tables and find matching data, you can either: Create a query that joins fields from each table where those fields contain corresponding information, either by using an existing relationship or by using a join that you create for the purpose of the query. This method provides optimum performance (the speed with which the query returns results), but you cannot join fields that have dissimilar data types. Create a query that compares fields by using one field ', \"t join fields that have dissimilar data types. Create a query that compares fields by using one field as a criterion for the other. Using a field as a criterion for another field is generally slower than using joins, because joins eliminate rows from a query's results before the underlying tables are read, whereas criteria are applied to a query's results after the underlying tables are read. However, you can use a field as a field criterion to compare fields that have dissimilar data types, which you cannot do by using joins. This article discusses how to compare two tables to identify matching data, and provides sample data that you can use with example procedures. What do you want to do? Compare two tables by using joins Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Compare two tables by using joins To compare two tables by using joins, you create a select query that includes both tables. If there is not already an existing relationship between the tables on the fields that contain the corresponding d\", \"not already an existing relationship between the tables on the fields that contain the corresponding data, you create a join on the fields that you want to examine for matches. You can create as many joins as you want, but each pair of joined fields must be of the same or compatible data type. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a table that stores student major data and a table that stores class enrollment data. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors since the recent curriculum changes, you need to review records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. Prepare sample data In this example, you build a query that determines how re\", \"rds in the majors table. Prepare sample data In this example, you build a query that determines how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected math students' grades. You use the following two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments. Add these two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments, to a database. Access provides several ways to add these sample tables to a database. You can enter the data manually, you can copy each table into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Office Excel 2007), and then import the worksheets into Access, or you can paste the data into a text editor, such as Notepad, and then import the data from the resulting text files. The steps in this section explain how to enter data manually in a blank datasheet, and also explain how to copy the sample tables to Excel, and then import those tables into Access. Student Majors Class Enrollments If you want to use a spreadsheet program to enter the sample data, you can skip the following section . E\", 'you want to use a spreadsheet program to enter the sample data, you can skip the following section . Enter the sample data manually Open a new or existing database. On the Create tab, in the Tables group, click Table . Access adds a new, blank table to your database. Note: You do not need to follow this step if you open a new, blank database, but you will need to follow it whenever you need to add a table to the database. Double-click the first cell in the header row, and then type the name of the field in the sample table. By default, Access denotes blank fields in the header row with the text Add New Field , such as: Use the arrow keys to move to the next blank header cell, and then type the second field name. (You can also double-click the new cell.) Repeat this step for each field name. Enter the data in the sample table. As you enter the data, Access infers a data type for each field. Each field has a specific data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time. Setting data types helps ensure accurate data en', 'ecific data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time. Setting data types helps ensure accurate data entry and also helps prevent mistakes, such as using a telephone number in a calculation. For these sample tables, allow Access to infer the data type, but be sure to review the data type that Access infers for each field. After you finish entering the data, click Save , or press CTRL+S. The Save As dialog box appears. In the Table Name box, type the name of the sample table, and then click OK . You use the name of each sample table (for example, Student Majors) because the queries in the procedure sections of this article also use those names. After you finish entering the sample data, you are ready to compare the two tables . Skip the following section (Create the sample worksheets), unless you want to learn how to create a worksheet that is based on the sample data from the tables in the preceding section. Create the sample worksheets Start your spreadsheet program, and create a new, blank file. If you use E', 'reate the sample worksheets Start your spreadsheet program, and create a new, blank file. If you use Excel, a new, blank workbook is created by default when you start the program. Copy the first sample table from the preceding section and paste it into the first worksheet, starting at the first cell. Be sure that you copy the header row, because it contains the field names of the sample table. Using the technique provided by your spreadsheet program, give the worksheet the same name as the sample table. For example, when you paste the Class Enrollments sample data, name the worksheet Class Enrollments. Repeat steps 2 and 3, copying the second sample table to a blank worksheet and renaming the worksheet. Note: You may need to add worksheets to your spreadsheet file. For information about adding worksheets to your spreadsheet file, see the help for your spreadsheet program. Save the workbook to a convenient location on your computer or your network, and go to the next set of steps. Create database tables from t', 'ation on your computer or your network, and go to the next set of steps. Create database tables from the worksheets In a new or existing database: On the External Data tab, in the Import group, click Excel . -or- Click More , and then select a spreadsheet program from the list. The Get External Data - Program Name Spreadsheet dialog box appears. Click Browse , locate and open the spreadsheet file that you created in the previous steps, and then click OK . The Import Spreadsheet Wizard starts. By default, the wizard selects the first worksheet in the workbook (Student Majors, if you followed the steps in the previous section), and data from that worksheet appears in the lower section of the wizard page. Click Next . On the next page of the wizard, select the First Row Contains Column Headings check box, and then click Next . On the next page, you can use the text boxes and lists under Field Options to change field names and data types, or to omit fields from the import operation. For this example, you do not n', 'ield names and data types, or to omit fields from the import operation. For this example, you do not need to change anything. Click Next . On the next page, select the No primary key option, and then click Next . By default, Access applies the name of the worksheet to your new table. Accept the name in the Import to Table box, and then click Finish . On the Save Import Steps page, click Close to complete the wizard. Repeat steps 1 through 7 until you have created a table from each worksheet in the spreadsheet file. Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using joins Now you are ready to compare the Class Enrollments table and the Student Majors table. Because you have not defined relationships between the two tables, you need to create joins between the appropriate fields in the query. The tables have more than one field in common, and you will need to create a join for each pair of common fields: Student ID, Year, and Curriculum (Class Enrollments table) and Major (Student Majors table). In th', 'ds: Student ID, Year, and Curriculum (Class Enrollments table) and Major (Student Majors table). In this example, you are only interested in math majors, so you will also use a field criterion to limit the query results. Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. On the Create tab, click Query Design . Double-click the table that contains the records that you want to display\\xa0— in this example, the Class Enrollments table, and then double-click the table to which you are comparing it\\xa0— in this example, the Student Majors table. Drag the Student ID field from the Class Enrollments table to the Student ID field of the Student Majors table. A line appears between the two tables in the design grid, indicating that you have created a join. Double-click the line to open the Join Properties dialog box. Review the three options in the Join Properties dialog box. By default, option 1 is selected. In some cases, you need to adjust the join properties to include extra rows from one table. Because you are try', \"ases, you need to adjust the join properties to include extra rows from one table. Because you are trying to find only matching data, leave the join set to option 1. Close the Join Properties dialog box by clicking Cancel . You will need to create two other joins. Create these joins by dragging the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then by dragging the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field on the Student Majors table. In the Class Enrollments table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) to add all of the table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column\", 'e-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column in the query design grid. In the Criteria row of the Major column, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Sometimes you may want to compare tables on the basis of fields that have matching data, but have different data types. For example, a field in one table may have a Number data type, and you want to compare that field to a field in another table that has a Text data type. Fields that contain similar data yet have different field types can result when numbers are stored as text, either by design, or for other reasons, such as importing data from another program. Because you cannot create joins between fields that have different data types, you will need to use a different method to compare the fields. You can compare two fields that have different dat', \"ed to use a different method to compare the fields. You can compare two fields that have different data types by using one field as a criterion for the other. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a Student Majors table and a Class Enrollments table. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors, you need to look at records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. However, one of the fields that you want to use to compare the tables has a different data type from its counterpart. To compare two tables by using a field as a criterion, you create a select query that includes both tables. You include the fields that you want to display, and y\", 'reate a select query that includes both tables. You include the fields that you want to display, and you also include the field that corresponds to the field that you want to use as a criterion. You then create a criterion to compare the tables. You can create as many criteria to compare fields as you want. To illustrate this method, you will use the sample tables from the previous section , but you will change the data type of the Student ID field of the sample Student Majors table from Number to Text. Because you cannot create a join between two fields that have different data types, you will have to compare the two Student ID fields by using one field as a criterion for the other. Change the data type of the Student Majors Student ID field Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. In the Navigation Pane , right-click the Student Majors table, and then click Design View on the shortcut menu. The Student Majors table opens in Design view. In the Data Type column, change the setting for Student ', 'he Student Majors table opens in Design view. In the Data Type column, change the setting for Student ID from Number to Text . Close the Student Majors table. When you are prompted to save changes, click Yes . Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using a field criterion The following procedure shows how to compare the two Student ID fields by using the field from Class Enrollments as a criterion for the field from Student Majors. By using the Like keyword, you can compare the fields, even though they have different data types. On the Create tab, in the Other group, click Query Design . Double-click Class Enrollments , and then double-click Student Majors . Drag the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then drag the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field of the Student Majors table. Because these fields have the same data types, you can compare them by using joins. Joins are the preferred method for compar', \"ve the same data types, you can compare them by using joins. Joins are the preferred method for comparing fields that have the same data type. Double-click the asterisk ( * ) on the Class Enrollments table to add all of that table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Student ID field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Student ID column of the design grid. In the Criteria row of the Student ID column, type Like [Class Enrollments].[Student ID] . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column of the design grid. In the Criteria row, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The qu\", \"ign grid. In the Criteria row, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Need more help? Want more options?

Less This article explains how to create and run an append query. You use an append query when you need to add new record', \"xplains how to create and run an append query. You use an append query when you need to add new records to an existing table by using data from other sources. If you need to change data in an existing set of records, such as updating the value of a field, you can use an update query. If you need to make a new table from a selection of data, or to merge two tables into one new table, you can use a make-table query. For more information about update queries or make-table queries, or for general information about other ways to add records to a database or change existing data, see the See Also section. In this article Overview Create and run an append query Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query Overview An append query selects records from one or more data sources and copies the selected records to an existing table. For example, suppose that you acquire a database that contains a table of potential new customers, and that you already have a table in your existing database that stores that kind of data. You'd\", \"mers, and that you already have a table in your existing database that stores that kind of data. You'd like to store the data in one place, so you decide to copy it from the new database into your existing table. To avoid entering the new data manually, you can use an append query to copy the records. Benefits of using an append query By using a query to copy data, you can: Append multiple records in one pass If you copy data manually, you usually have to perform multiple copy/paste operations. By using a query, you select all the data at once, and then copy it. Review your selection before you copy it You can view your selection in Datasheet view and can make adjustments to your selection as needed before you copy the data. This can be particularly handy if your query includes criteria or expressions, and you need several tries to get it just right. You cannot undo an append query. If you make a mistake, you must either restore your database from a backup or correct your error, either manually or by using a \", \" must either restore your database from a backup or correct your error, either manually or by using a delete query. Use criteria to refine your selection For example, you might want to only append records of customers who live in your city. Append records when some of the fields in the data sources don't exist in the destination table For example, suppose that your existing customer table has eleven fields, and the new table that you want to copy from only has nine of those eleven fields. You can use an append query to copy the data from the nine fields that match and leave the other two fields blank. Basic steps of an append query The process of creating an append query follows these basic steps: Create a select query You start by selecting the data that you want to copy. You can adjust your select query as needed, and run it as many times as you want to make sure you are selecting the data that you want to copy. Convert the select query to an append query After your selection is ready, you change the query \", 'copy. Convert the select query to an append query After your selection is ready, you change the query type to Append . Choose the destination fields for each column in the append query In some cases, Access automatically chooses the destination fields for you. You can adjust the destination fields, or choose them if Access did not. Preview and run the query to append the records Before you append the records, you can switch to Datasheet view for a preview of the appended records. Important: You cannot undo an append query. Consider backing up your database or the destination table. Create and run an append query In this section Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query Step 3: Choose the destination fields Step 4: Preview and run the append query Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Open the database that contains the records that you want to copy. On the Create tab, in the Queries group, click Query Design . Double-click the table', \"you want to copy. On the Create tab, in the Queries group, click Query Design . Double-click the tables or queries that contain the records that you want to copy, and then click Close . The tables or queries appear as one or more windows in the query designer. Each window lists the fields in a table or query. This figure shows a typical table in the query designer. 1. Assets table shown in the query designer 2. Query design grid Double-click each field that you want to append. The selected fields appear in the Field row in the query design grid. The data types of the fields in the source table must be compatible with the data types of the fields in the destination table. Text fields are compatible with most other types of fields. Number fields are only compatible with other number fields. For example, you can append numbers to a text field, but you cannot append text into a number field. You can also use an expression as a field \\xa0— such as =Date() to automatically return today's date\\xa0— and you can use express\", \"xpression as a field \\xa0— such as =Date() to automatically return today's date\\xa0— and you can use expressions with table or query fields in the design grid to customize the data that you select. For example, if your destination table has a field that stores a four-digit year and the source table has a regular date/time field, you might use the DatePart function with the source field to select only the year. To quickly add all the fields in a table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) at the top of the list of table fields. This figure shows the design grid with all fields added. Optionally, you can enter one or more criteria in the Criteria row of the design grid. The following table shows some example criteria and explains the effect they have on a query. On the Query Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . Verify that the query returned the records that you want to copy. If you need to add or remove fields from the query, switch back to Design view and add fields as described in the preceding step, or select\", \"rom the query, switch back to Design view and add fields as described in the preceding step, or select the fields that you don't want and press DELETE to remove them from the query. Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query On the Home tab, in the View group, click View , and then click Design View . On the Query Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Append . The Append dialog box appears. Next, you specify whether to append records to a table in the current database, or to a table in a different database. Do one of the following: In the Append dialog box, click Current Database , select the destination table from the Table Name combo box, and then click OK . -or- In the Append dialog box, click Another Database . In the File Name box, enter the location and name of the destination database. In the Table Name combo box, enter the name of the destination table, and then click OK . Step 3: Choose the destination fields The way that you choose destination fields depends on how you created your sel\", ' the destination fields The way that you choose destination fields depends on how you created your select query in Step 1. If Access leaves fields blank, you can click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. This figure illustrates how you click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. Note: If you leave the destination field blank, the query will not append data to that field. Step 4: Preview and run the append query To preview your changes, switch to Datasheet view. Tip: To quickly switch views, right-click the tab at the top of the query, and then click the view that you want. Return to Design view, and then click Run to append the records. Note: While running a query that returns a large amount of data you might get an error message indicating that you will not be able to undo the query. Try increasing the limit on the memory segment to 3MB to allow the query to go through. Top of Page Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query If you try to run an append query and it ', \"hrough. Top of Page Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query If you try to run an append query and it seems like nothing happens, check the Access status bar for the following message: This action or event has been blocked by Disabled Mode. To fix this, click Enable Content in the Message Bar to enable the query. Note: When you enable the append query, you also enable all other database content. If you don't see the Message Bar, it may be hidden. You can show it, unless it has also been disabled. If the Message Bar has been disabled, you can enable it.

It is available by clicking Database Tools > Relationships . Relationships are like the rules that govern how data is connected in your dat', 'Tools > Relationships . Relationships are like the rules that govern how data is connected in your database. In a well-normalized order-processing database, for example, most likely you’ll have customer information in one table and order information in another table. You want to make sure customers don’t get separated from their orders, right? And you don’t want an order to be created that doesn’t have a valid customer connected to it. The Relationships window is where you go to set these rules so that they apply throughout your database. If you’ve built an Access query before, you’ll notice that the Relationships window looks a lot like the top part of the Query Builder: In the Relationships window, you use the commands on the Design tab to add tables to the view, and then you drag fields between tables to set up the relationships. In this example, the relationship allows for multiple orders to be connected to each customer, but it keeps you from creating an order for a customer that doesn’t exist. Once you ', 'to each customer, but it keeps you from creating an order for a customer that doesn’t exist. Once you set up these rules in the Relationships window, they’ll apply to the whole database (for example, if you create a new query, the joins will automatically be set up according to your relationship rules). Note: Deleting a table from the Relationships window won’t delete it from your database, nor will it remove relationships that you’ve already established.

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn\\xa0different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see w', 'een two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three\\xa0related tables: Customers CustomerDiscounts Orders Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously\\xa0import multiple tables. You can also use ', 'automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously\\xa0import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each\\xa0contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID ', 'In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in th', 'ique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship.\\xa0The foreign key is referred to as the\\xa0source column or just column.\\xa0In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default\\xa0Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table.\\xa0However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is\\xa0one-to-one. I', 'ers, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is\\xa0one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has\\xa0a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel\\xa0must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have m', 'more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you ', 'wing requirements are met: Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A\\xa0composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To\\xa0create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in.', 'ou import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A\\xa0Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables\\xa0in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an\\xa0Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a\\xa0workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Table 2, column f Table 2, column f\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Table 3, column n Table 3, column n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection a', 'a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot\\xa0analyzes the data in the tables. It\\xa0detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. Fo', 'ypes are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the l', 'ake sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic De', ' automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for ', \"elationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Putting it all into play Conclusion The Golden Rules of Data Visualization The visual representation of data tables needs to support the inherent idea, information \", 'isualization The visual representation of data tables needs to support the inherent idea, information in the data, and visualize the storytelling. When it comes to presenting data on different visual and style, we can plunge right in and show you what works the most for us. But you need to think about all the usefulness, purpose and display mode before even considering what method you should utilize. As you make data tables, remember that it takes people some effort to digest a complex chart or data table. Take the effort to spell out the story, fundamentals via better table UI design so that it’s clear to someone who hasn’t been poring over that dataset from the beginning. Avoid using complex designs, flashy fonts, or too many colors when telling a data-driven story.

Depending on the desired visual design, some effort requires the WordPress Plugins and add-ons to prettify those tables.

Some often think to themselves, ‘We need a big flashy tab', 'are frequently practiced in the wrong order. Some often think to themselves, ‘We need a big flashy table with vibrant background here’ or even worse: ‘Every row with different color is interesting, just push those in’. Let’s rethink and ask this, ‘This is the data I need to present; let’s find the best way to show that.’ Aligning purpose with UI design is all that is needed. “In school we learn a lot about language and math. On the language side we learn how to put words together into sentences and stories. With math, we learn to make sense of numbers. But it’s rare that these two sides are paired. No one tells us how to tell stories with numbers … this leaves us poorly prepared for an important task that is increasingly in demand.” –\\xa0Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic Now the question is, how can data table UI design stand out from the competition? Let’s look at how great tables can be built on different websites in 2023 since tables don’t seem to be going out of style anytime soon. Keep it simple Let’s start with a si', '23 since tables don’t seem to be going out of style anytime soon. Keep it simple Let’s start with a simple yet effective scenario. If your data arranges itself nicely into a table with many rows and a few columns then the data table is effectively conveying the message or idea from the start. You can build it up from here when neccessary. Occasionally, sticking to the basics can be more useful than any flashy UI design and styling. Although it’s a low-effort practice, a little extra effort goes a long way. Created with Ninja Tables By using alignment, spacing, and size, you can easily achieve a user-friendly, comprehensive, and readable\\xa0 table. As for customized background, use it only when it makes sense. For example, in any festivity use customized background to add a little flair to the table.

Allow data on a narrow screen to shrink and resize as ', 't compromising the readability and credibility. Allow data on a narrow screen to shrink and resize as needed without losing its purpose. Tip 1 : Do nothing extra Tip 2 : Don’t stretch tables Don’t make it wordy Try to avoid using too much texts in the table, it makes the table look cluttered and hard to keep track. Shorten the texts, use separate columns if necessary. This pattern works best if your data itself isn’t full of texts. If they are numeric, or short texts, you can probably get away with not doing much. To create a clean and organized look in your tables, it’s important to minimize the use of lengthy text entries. Too much text can clutter the table and make it hard to keep track. Instead, opt for concise word or numeric values. If you have information that requires more explanation, use separate columns to avoid overcrowding.

They serve to maintain a visual reference to the data in columns, making it easier for users to understand and navigate the information. Pricing tables When it comes to showcasing prices or included features, it’s ideal to utilize tables that present all the details together on a single screen.

They let us plan for the future. The United Nations (UN) publishes projections in its World Population Prospects . It has been doing this periodically for more than 50 years. But how much should we trust these projections? One way to gauge the credibility of UN projections for the future is to look back at its track record of predictions in the past. In this article, I compare the UN’s historical projections to the latest population estimates to see how close they were. Most of the UN’s historical population projections have been close to final estimates Many of the UN’s historical projections – even as far back as the 1960s – have been remarkably close to the truth. Every few years, the UN publishes a new report on population trends, which it calls a “revision”. The report published in 2022 is called the “2022 revision”; the one from 1990 is the “1990 revision”, etc. In the chart, I’ve show', ' is called the “2022 revision”; the one from 1990 is the “1990 revision”, etc. In the chart, I’ve shown a range of these historical revisions, with their projections for the world population between 1970 and 2020. The UN’s latest population estimates – which is our closest estimate of the true population – are also shown for comparison. If you hover over the ‘latest observed’ data label on the chart you can see how it compares to the various projections around it. As you can see, most historical projections were close to the final figure, even when projecting three to four decades in the future. We’ll take a close look at the exact figures below. Most projections differed from the latest estimates by just 1% to 2%. Many were within 1%, and none differed by more than 5%. 1 This is not bad, especially considering that global estimates of the world population today can vary by around 1% between sources. 2 We can also take a closer look at how these historical projections stack up. In the table, I’ve provided the', ' also take a closer look at how these historical projections stack up. In the table, I’ve provided the latest population estimates from the UN in the top row (so you can see the global population in 1980, 1990, 2000, etc.). Below are the exact numbers that each UN population revision projected for these same years. So you can see that the 1968 revision projected that the world population in 1980 would be 4.46 billion. The actual number was 4.44 billion. So, pretty close. But further out the difference becomes considerable — for the year 2000 the demographers back in the late 60s overestimated the world’s population size. You can see that the projections across the years did vary, but most clustered within a small range and came pretty close to the final estimate. Global projections have been relatively accurate, but this isn’t true for every region We should not assume that because global projections have been reasonably accurate, projections for individual countries or regions have been equally so. This also', 'n reasonably accurate, projections for individual countries or regions have been equally so. This also applies to specific age groups. Over- and under-estimates of particular populations canceled each other out, leading to a total figure that seemed more accurate than it was for individual groups. For example, an overestimate of the population in Asia could be partly canceled out by an underestimate in Europe. In a paper published in Population Studies , the researcher Nico Keilman, studied the accuracy of UN population projections by looking at the errors of large regions, age groups, and specific estimates of fertility and mortality trends. 3 To give one example: in Europe, UN projections would often overestimate the number of future children in a population but underestimate the number of elderly people. This was because the UN expected birth rates to be higher than they turned out, and it was at the same time too pessimistic about improvements in life expectancy (especially for women). Another significant', 'time too pessimistic about improvements in life expectancy (especially for women). Another significant error for some regions – affecting mostly Africa, Asia, and Latin America – was inaccurate population estimates in the first place (in what we would call the “base year” when the time-series starts). Many countries in these regions had poor census records and national statistics on the size and structure of the population. If the population in the start year is wrong, the projected population could be very wrong, even if you make reasonable assumptions about changes in fertility and mortality trends. Keilman notes that the quality of population data has improved over time, so this inaccuracy got smaller over time. Long-term projections are less accurate Global population projections often perform well when we compare them to reality 5, 10, or 20 years into the future. But over longer timescales, they often diverged from the real pathway. See the chart below, which extends the historical projections further i', 'iverged from the real pathway. See the chart below, which extends the historical projections further into the future – to 2030. You can see that in earlier years, there was much less variation between them. But with time, they start to diverge. This makes sense: to make projections about the population, researchers need to make assumptions about how fertility rates – the number of children the average woman has – and life expectancy will change. And researchers need to do this across the world, with very different starting points and socioeconomic futures. Small errors in these assumptions at the start of a trend will accumulate and turn into much larger ones. We can understand the challenges in making long-term projections by looking at the most recent UN projections. In its 2019 revision, the UN projected that the world population would not peak by the end of the century: it expected numbers to reach 10.9 billion by 2100 and continue to grow slowly in the early 22nd century. Its 2022 revision however made q', 'illion by 2100 and continue to grow slowly in the early 22nd century. Its 2022 revision however made quite a different projection : now the UN expects that the world population will peak at around 10.4 billion people in the mid-2080s. This update, of course, came from an improved understanding of how fertility rates and other demographic indicators were changing across the world. But it highlights how hard it is to predict these changes for every country, 50 to 100 years into the future. To summarize, short-to-medium-term projections have often been close to the true figure. But the global aggregates can hide errors on the national and regional level and we should be cautious about relying too heavily on long-term ones. Endnotes Here we look at UN reports dating back to 1968 – it was not possible to find earlier versions of UN reports.

The decelerating growth is mainly attributable to fertility declines in a growing number of countries. However, there are substantial variations in the future trends of populations across regions and countries, with sub-Saharan African countries being projected to have most of the increase. Population momentum plays an important role in determining the future population growth in many countries and areas where fertility is in a rapid transition. With declines in fertility, the world’s population is unprecedentedly aging, and the numbers of households with smaller sizes are growing. International migration is also on the rise since the beginning of this century. The world’s population is also urbanizing due to increased internal rural to urban migration. Nevertheless, there are uncertainties in future population growth, not only because there are uncert', '. Nevertheless, there are uncertainties in future population growth, not only because there are uncertainties in the future trends in fertility, mortality, and migration, but also because there are many other factors that could affect these trajectories. International consensus on climate change and ecosystem protections may trigger population control policies, and the ongoing pandemic is likely to have some impact on mortality, migration, or even fertility. Keywords: Population, Growth, Trends The future trend of a population is an outcome of the interactive dynamics between its existing age structure and its future trends in fertility, mortality, and migration. An abundance of scientific evidence shows that population growth in a country is connected to socioeconomic growth, environmental protection, health promotion, quality of life, and social stability. Understanding the growth dynamics and future trends of populations around the world is crucial to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development G', ' of populations around the world is crucial to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other long-term development goals. This article reviews the main features of recent and future trends in population growth for the world, major regions, and selected countries. We mainly rely on the estimates and projections of the 2019 Revision of the World Population Prospects (WPP 2019) produced by the United Nations Population Division ( 1 ) to focus on 201 countries and areas with 90,000 inhabitants or more in mid-2020. Go to: MAJOR TRENDS IN POPULATION GROWTH Continuing Gowth of the World Population at a Slowing Pace The world’s population continues to grow, reaching 7.8 billion by mid-2020, rising from 7 billion in 2010, 6 billion in 1998, and 5 billion in 1986. The average annual growth rate was around 1.1% in 2015–2020, which steadily decreased after it peaked at 2.3% in the late 1960s. Among 201 countries and areas, 73 countries had a smaller growth rate in 2010–2020 compared with th', 's. Among 201 countries and areas, 73 countries had a smaller growth rate in 2010–2020 compared with the previous decade; and out of these 73 countries, more than 60 are developing countries. The slowing pace of the population growth is closely related to declines in fertility. Globally, the total fertility rate was 2.4 births per woman of reproductive age in 2020, decreasing from 2.7 in 2000, 3.7 in 1980, and 5.0 in 1950. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, the total fertility rate has been below replacement level (2.1 births per woman) for a few decades, which is the level required to ensure the replacement of generations in low-mortality countries. In a few of these countries, total fertility rates have even fallen to extremely low levels, 1.5 births per woman, and even below 1.5 in some countries, for the past several decades. There is a myriad of reasons for the slowing pace of population growth that can be attributed to declining fertility in the context of a demographic transition mainly c', 'owth that can be attributed to declining fertility in the context of a demographic transition mainly caused by modernization. In the process of modernization, improved food security, nutrition, and public health, advances in medical technology and socioeconomic development, coupled with improved safe and effective family planning methods and services have largely improved child survival, which has enabled couples to have a desired number of children without having too many births. Improved education, enhanced women’s empowerment, increased financial security in old age, and personal aspirations for more opportunities regarding self-career development and a better life have all reshaped young couples’ views and behaviors about postponements of marriage and childbearing, and the numbers and timing of childbirths ( 2 - 3 ). All of these forces have led to reductions in fertility, and eventually triggered a demographic transition. By 2020, all countries and areas either have completed their demographic transition', 'raphic transition. By 2020, all countries and areas either have completed their demographic transition or are in the middle of the transition. However, even if fertility levels declined rapidly, the world population would likely continue to grow because of the momentum of population growth — a force that drives future population growth resulting from the existing age structure. Globally, more than two-thirds of the projected increase of 1.9 billion in population from 2020 to 2050 could be attributable to population momentum. In other words, population momentum is projected to produce 1.3 billion more people between 2020 and 2050, or 17% of the total in 2020. The contributions of above-replacement level fertility and declining mortality to the projected increase in 2020–2050 are 317 million (16% of the total increase) and 295 million (15%), respectively. The increases attributable to above-replacement level fertility and mortality are roughly equal to 4% each of the total in 2020. Although the growing trend in', 'rtility and mortality are roughly equal to 4% each of the total in 2020. Although the growing trend in the world population is expected to continue throughout this century at a slowing pace, there is uncertainty about future trends, and the uncertainty gets wider with time. For example, the world population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100, but their 95% projection intervals could be between 9.4 and 10.1 billion for 2050 and between 9.4 and 12.7 billion for 2100 ( Figure 1 ).

Large Variations in Growth Patterns Across Regions and Countries There are substantial variations in the future trends of populations across regions and countries. Overall, most countries and areas in the worl', 'ture trends of populations across regions and countries. Overall, most countries and areas in the world are projected to continue growing in 2020–2050. However, in the second half of the century, more than half of the countries and areas are projected to witness a decline. Among eight SDG regions, sub-Saharan Africa is expected to account for most of the increase in the world’s population throughout the century, and its global share of the population is projected to increase steadily. By contrast, the global shares of the population by other SDG regions are projected to decrease over time. Globally, there are 54 countries which have an annual growth rate twice as fast as the world average rate in 2020–2050, and 41 of these countries, or slightly more than three-fourths, are located in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, more than a half of the global additional 2.0 billion people projected increase between 2020 and 2050 are from countries in sub-Saharan Africa (regardless of scenarios), and such a proportion is proje', '050 are from countries in sub-Saharan Africa (regardless of scenarios), and such a proportion is projected to be about 90% in 2050–2100. Overall, about 23–38 million more people annually from sub-Saharan countries are projected to be added to the world’s total population. As a result, the current total population of sub-Saharan African countries, which was 1.1 billion in 2020 (or similar to the Europe and Northern America combined), is projected to climb to 3.8 billion by 2100 with a 95% projection interval between 3.0 and 4.8 billion. By contrast, the total population of Europe and Northern America combined will maintain its current level by 2100 ( Figure 2 ).

Although a fast-growing population in some developing countries provides a large young population base, which could be a favorable factor for economic growth when this young population enters the labor force, these countries are facing challenges associated with a large young population, such as low access to education among children (especially among girls), relatively high levels of infant, child, and maternal mortality, and relatively high unmet needs in family planning services. High fertility has also caused young couples to have unwanted pregnancies and births that otherwise could relieve them of childbearing and childrearing obligations for other opportunities of human development ( 2 ). Another major feature of the world’s future population growth is that the majority of the projected increase in the world’s total population is attributed to a very few populous (or fast growing', 'ojected increase in the world’s total population is attributed to a very few populous (or fast growing) countries. For example, under the medium variant of WPP 2019, nine countries (India, United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the United Republic of Tanzania) are projected to account for more than half of the increase in global population between 2020 and 2050. Except for the United States, all are developing countries and are low-income or low-middle-income countries. Low education among children, high fertility levels, high maternal mortality, and high unmet needs in family planning services in many of these countries are major obstacles for achieving SDGs ( 4 ). In contrast to most countries where populations are projected to increase in 2020–2050, populations in some countries are projected to decline. There were 18 countries and areas, mostly in Europe, that had a negative population growth rate in the last 3 decades (1990–2020), and the numbe', 'in Europe, that had a negative population growth rate in the last 3 decades (1990–2020), and the number of countries and areas with a negative growth rate is projected to reach 46 in the next 3 decades (2020–2050), including several Asian countries. Almost all countries in Latin American and the Caribbean are projected to continue to grow in 2020–2050, but many of them are projected to be on a declining track in 2050–2100. China, the most populated country in the contemporary world, had a total population of 1.43 billion in 2020 and was a major contributor to the world’s population growth over the past several decades. Under the medium variant of WPP 2019 ( Figure 3 ), China is projected to have some loss in its total population, with 1.40 billion by 2050, after peaking at 1.46 billion around 2030. Japan has seen the largest losses in population size since the beginning of this century; however, China is projected to eclipse this and will become the largest country with a decreasing population (of 30 million ', 'ected to eclipse this and will become the largest country with a decreasing population (of 30 million by 2050). By 2100, China is projected to have a loss of more than a quarter of its current size. For India, the world’s second most populous country in the contemporary world, it is projected to continue to grow and will overtake China as the largest population in 2025–2030, reaching 1.64 billion by 2050. However, India is projected to witness population decline after reaching its peak around 1.65 billion in 2055–2060 due to falling fertility. By 2100, India is projected to reach 1.45 billion and to have the second largest loss in population in 2050–2100 after China, followed by Brazil and Bangladesh, ranking the third and fourth largest losses in population, respectively.

Source: Drawn from the World Population Prospects 2019 ( 1 ). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that there is uncertainty in the future growth of populations and the uncertainty gets wider in the more distant future. For example, the 95% projected low and high bounds for China could be 1.32 to 1.50 billion by 2050, and 0.82 to 1.33 billion by 2100, respectively. The corresponding figures for India are 1.47 to 1.81 billion by 2050, and 8.87 to 2.18 billion by 2100 ( Figure 3 ). Contributions of Population Momentum, Fertility, and Mortality to Population Growth Future population growth depends on population momentum, future fertility, mortality, and migration trends. The population momentum refers to an inherent driving force for population growth resulted from the existing age structure. A young age structure leads to increases in population even if fertility is kept constantly at replac', ' A young age structure leads to increases in population even if fertility is kept constantly at replacement level, whereas an older age structure could lead slower growth or even decreases in population ( 5 ). There is a large variation in the contribution of these components to future population growth for individual countries and regions. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, relative to the total population in 2020, the total increase in population due to population momentum between 2020 and 2050 is projected to be equal to 40% of the 2020 total; the increase in population due to higher fertility (above replacement level) is projected to be equal to 53% of the 2020 total. The contributions by mortality and migration are very small. In Europe, both low fertility and population momentum are projected to cause population losses between 2020 and 2050. Although improvements in mortality and increasing migration are projected to offset some of the population losses in this period, the overall trend in population s', 're projected to offset some of the population losses in this period, the overall trend in population size is projected to decline. In Northern America, the population is expected to continue to grow in 2020–2050 largely fueled by declines in mortality and positive net migration, and, to a lesser extent, by positive population momentum. This growth is expected to be partially dampened by the negative contribution of low fertility. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the increases in population between 2020 and 2050 due to population momentum and improved mortality are projected to be equal to 5% and 3% of its current total, respectively; whereas low fertility in the regions is projected to bring negative population growth by 5% of its current total. The contribution of migration is negligible. Trends in China are similar to this regional pattern, although the actual levels are somewhat different. In Japan, however, the overall pattern is close to that of Europe rather than that of their geographical region. In ', 'ver, the overall pattern is close to that of Europe rather than that of their geographical region. In Central and Southern Asia, while fertility is projected to bring zero growth to the future population, population momentum is projected to add one-quarter of its population to the current total. The contributions of mortality and migration in this region are negligible. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the increases in population are driven mostly by population momentum, with an additional (although small) contribution of improved mortality. Fertility is projected to contribute significantly to population decline, about 5% of the current population size. Unprecedented Challenges of Population Aging in Many Countries With progress along the demographic transition, coupled with other societal developments, most countries have experienced declining fertility and improved mortality, marked by the elimination/reduction of many fatal infectious diseases that have prolonged life expectancy. Global life expectancy', 'eduction of many fatal infectious diseases that have prolonged life expectancy. Global life expectancy at birth has reached 73 years in 2020, 7 years more than that in 2000, and nearly 30 years more than that in 1950. It has been documented that life expectancy at birth for the best performing countries in history have witnessed an increase of 2.0–2.5 years per decade over the last few centuries ( 4 ). It is now projected that global life expectancy at birth will reach 77 years by 2050 and 82 years by 2100. Life expectancy at birth could even be over 95 years by 2100 in Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Spain, although it is projected to remain below 80 years in some African countries. Paralleling the unprecedented rise in life expectancy is the unprecedented growth of population aging ( 6 ). A population is typically considered an aging population if the proportion of its adults aged 65 or older (or old-age proportion) is over 7%. Likewise, it is called an aged, a super-aged, and an ultra-aged populat', 'ld-age proportion) is over 7%. Likewise, it is called an aged, a super-aged, and an ultra-aged population if the old-age proportion is over 14%, 21%, and 28%, respectively ( 7 ). Globally, the proportion of people aged 65 or older reached 9.3% in 2020, rising from 6.9% in 2000, and 5.1% in 1950 ( Table 1 ). The global old-age proportion is projected to reach 15.9% in 2050 and 22.4% in 2100. Table 1 Distribution of countries by the percent of the population aged 65 or older for selected years. Open in a separate window In some developed countries (or countries with rapid fertility declines), the proportion of older people is much higher. For example, the old-age proportion in Japan, the most aged population in the contemporary world, was 28.4% in 2020, rising from 17.0% in 2000, and 4.9% in 1950. Table 1 shows that by 2050, nearly 58% of the 201 countries are projected to be in an aged society, and nearly 15% of these countries are projected to be in an ultra-aged society; in comparison to the less than 30% of', 'of these countries are projected to be in an ultra-aged society; in comparison to the less than 30% of countries in an aged society in 2020 and only one country in an ultra-aged society (Japan). By 2100, nearly 90% of these countries are projected to be an aged society, and more than half are project to be an ultra-aged society. Population aging has had a profound impact on old-age care, pension and social security systems, housing, savings, labor supplies, social services, and in many other sectors ( 6 ). These challenges are more pressing for developing countries because they are facing these challenges within a much shorter time frame, and long before they become economically well off, to prepare for such rapid population aging (“aging before rich”). With few exceptions (e.g., Japan), most developed countries took 40 to 120 years to transform from an aging population (7%) to an aged population (14%) and took (or will take) 20 to 50 years to transform from an aged society (14%) to a super-aged society (21%)', 'ok (or will take) 20 to 50 years to transform from an aged society (14%) to a super-aged society (21%). In contrast, most developing countries will take 15–35 years to transform from an aging population to an aged population and 10–30 years to transform from an aged population to a super-aged population. Based on some empirical evidence, and potential trajectories of mortality and fertility, it is projected that the number of years to transform from a super-aged population into an ultra-aged population will be shorter than the number of years transforming from an aged society to a super-aged society for both developed and developing countries. Such an unprecedented growth of older populations in the world has required reforms in pension systems and statutory retirement ages in many countries, especially in more developed countries in order to maintain fiscal sustainability of existing public pension systems ( 8 ). However, rapid population aging can also open additional windows of opportunity for economic gro', ' 8 ). However, rapid population aging can also open additional windows of opportunity for economic growth — such as a “second economic dividend” when low fertility and prolonged longevity stimulate human capital investments ( 9 ). This is especially the case when population aging is accompanied by better health (i.e., “compression of morbidity”) that has been observed in many older populations ( 10 ). Better health and prolonged longevity could allow labor force participation among older adults to offset downward pressures on economic growth ( 6 ). Research has shown that the benefits of a second dividend are estimated to be larger and more lasting than the first dividend ( 9 ), leaving policymakers an opportunity to optimize transitory economic growth from the first dividend into a sustained one. Growing Role of International Migration It is estimated that the number of persons who live outside of their countries of birth reached 281 million in 2020 globally, an increase from 108 million over the amount in 2', 'tries of birth reached 281 million in 2020 globally, an increase from 108 million over the amount in 2000 ( 11 ). Although international migration does not have a direct impact on the world’s population growth, and its impact on population growth is usually negligible in most countries compared to other demographic components, it has contributed significantly to the growth of populations in some countries. For example, in the past few decades, international labor migration inflows in several Gulf States have contributed to rapid population growth in these countries. It was estimated that labor immigrants accounted for more than three-fourths of the working-age population in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar in the last couple of decades. Globally, about two-thirds of international migrants are concentrated in just 20 countries — with the United States as the largest destination country, followed by Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom, which all have over 10 million imm', 'many, Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom, which all have over 10 million immigrants. On the other hand, about one-third of all global migrants originated in only 10 countries — with India as the largest out-migration country, followed by Mexico, China, and the Russian Federation, which have over 10 million emigrants. Overall, high-income countries host nearly two-thirds of all international migrants, and Europe continues to host the largest number of migrants in the world, followed by Northern America. The number of male international migrants is slightly higher than that of female migrants. Most international migration is for labor or family reasons. However, the number of forcibly displaced migrants due to humanitarian crises in many parts of the world grew rapidly, reaching 34 million in 2020, an increase from 17 million compared with 2000 ( 11 ). Migration can contribute to sustainable development in both origin and destination countries, which has been widely acknowledged in the', 'inable development in both origin and destination countries, which has been widely acknowledged in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration ( 11 ). As most migrants are working-age adults, positive net migration can also offset a shortage of labor supply and population decline, as well as slow down population aging in destination countries. For countries and areas of origin, as migrants are mostly healthy, highly educated, and skilled young adults, a large scale of out-migration may cause possible brain drains and accelerate population aging. However, migrants’ remittances to countries and areas of origin could improve the livelihood and education of population left behind, boost socioeconomic development, and reduce mortality. All these promote sustainable development in origin countries and areas ( 11 ). Nevertheless, as migrants often face many disadvantages — including language barriers, low social integration and isolation, and a low like', 'many disadvantages — including language barriers, low social integration and isolation, and a low likelihood of being eligible for pensions, healthcare, and/or education compared with those who are native born — how to better protect their rights and remove obstacles that prevent them from discrimination is a key goal for achieving SDGs and leaving no one behind. An Urbanizing World Urbanization, usually measured by the percentage urban (i.e., urban population as a percentage of the total population), is the spatial re-distribution of the population of a country or an area, mainly resulting from internal or domestic migration. Given the close relationships among urbanization, socioeconomic development, and the environment, it is crucial to understand the long-term trends in urbanization in addition to the trends in population size and composition. Just like international migration will not change the world’s population, internal or domestic migration within a country will not change the population of that cou', 'population, internal or domestic migration within a country will not change the population of that country. However, internal migration, especially rural-to-urban migration can have a huge impact on the total population in both the origin and destination cities of a given country, which is normally a major driving force for rapid urbanization, such as in the case of China ( 12 ). The world’s population is urbanizing rapidly. The percentage urban was 56% in 2020, rising from 50% in 2007, 43% in 1990, and less than 30% in 1950 ( Table 2 ). It is projected to reach more than 68% in 2050 ( 13 ). There are large variations in urbanization levels and growth rates across regions and countries, with the percentage urban more than 80% in Northern America and, Latin America and the Caribbean, 75% in Europe, and around 40% in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. From 2000 to 2020, with the exception of a very few countries, all other countries witnessed an increase in urbanization — with nearly 40 countries having an annual grow', 'other countries witnessed an increase in urbanization — with nearly 40 countries having an annual growth rate greater at 1.5%; and all countries are projected to continue to urbanize from 2020 to 2050, albeit with different annual growth rates ranging from 0.01% to over 2.0%. Most developing countries are projected to have a much faster growth rate than developed countries. China has been the biggest contributor to global urbanization from 2000 to 2020, thanks to its massive scale of rural-to-urban migration. From 2020 to 2050, China is projected to continue to play a major role in global urbanization, although India will overtake China as the largest contributor. Nigeria is projected to be the third largest contributor to the world’s urbanization growth in the next three decades ( 13 ). Table 2 Distribution of countries by percentage urban for selected years. Open in a separate window Fast Growing Numbers of Households with Decreasing Size All human beings are connected to others by blood or marriage, and ge', ' Households with Decreasing Size All human beings are connected to others by blood or marriage, and generally live together in families or households. Dynamic changes in household size and composition over time are indeed another form of population growth. Households are often a more relevant unit for analyzing energy-related consumption, human impacts on the environment, and likewise sustainable development because energy-related commodities such as water, food, vehicles, housing, and social services are often purchased and consumed by households, rather than by individuals ( 14 - 15 ). There is ample empirical evidence showing that the average size of households has declined steadily over the past several decades for most countries in the world ( 16 ). For example, in Brazil, the average household size declined from 5.1 persons per household in 1960 to 3.3 persons per household in 2010. The corresponding figures were 3.8 and 3.2 for the United Kingdom, and 3.5 and 2.6 for the United States. The average hous', 'gures were 3.8 and 3.2 for the United Kingdom, and 3.5 and 2.6 for the United States. The average household size for India also declined from 5.8 persons per household in 1980 to around 4.5 persons per household in 2010. China’s household size decreased from 4.7 in 1981 to 3.2 in 2010, and further down to 2.62 in 2020 ( 17 ). Such decreases in household size have led to faster growth in the number of households as compared to the growth of the population ( 18 ). The faster growth of households will likely persist in the foreseeable future. Globally, the average household size for all countries was around 4 persons per household in 2010, ranging from 2.1 in Finland and Germany to 8 persons per household in Afghanistan ( 16 ). It was estimated that if the average household size had been 2.5 people globally in 2010, the number of households in the world would be 2.7 billion, 0.8 billion more (or a 41% increase) than the current total of 1.9 billion ( 14 ). In addition to declining fertility, higher divorce rates', 'than the current total of 1.9 billion ( 14 ). In addition to declining fertility, higher divorce rates, more internal and international migration, and the diminishing norms of co-residence have all contributed to the growth of smaller household sizes ( 16 ). The living arrangements of older adults is an important component of household composition, which have been receiving increasing attention. The living arrangements of older adults are the result of a nexus of personal preferences, needs, available resources, and culture. Coresidence with adult children and/or grandchildren is very common in many countries and areas in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, where coresidence is usually over 40% (and even reaches over 80% in some countries). In contrast, coresidence is relatively low among older adults in Europe and Northern America, where the most common living arrangement of older adults is living with a spouse only or living alone ( 19 ). With the progress of modernization and advances in soc', 'ving with a spouse only or living alone ( 19 ). With the progress of modernization and advances in socioeconomic development, the number of older adults in many developing countries preferring to live with their spouses only and/or live alone is growing in most countries. In China, for instance, the percentage of those living with only a spouse or alone witnessed a steady increase over the last several decades, from 25% in 1982 to 35% in 2010 ( 20 - 21 ). Research has shown that the living arrangement of older adults is linked to various health outcomes and the use of (in)formal services; which implies that the fast growing trend in the numbers of households coupled with its reducing size could have important implications for the planning of long-term care, housing, and social services in the context of rapid population aging. Overall, the trends in household size and composition and older adult living arrangements are important for sustainable development, especially when such trends are connected with energ', 'ements are important for sustainable development, especially when such trends are connected with energy-related consumption and old-age care. Go to: DISCUSSION The world’s population is projected to continue to grow at a slowing pace during this century. Such a trend of decelerating growth is mainly due to fertility declines in a growing number of countries. However, many sub-Saharan African countries are projected to have much faster growth than countries in other regions of the world — because many sub-Saharan African countries still have high fertility rates and reductions in fertility have been stalling in recent years. In these countries, more effort is needed to prioritize the enhancement and empowerment of women, improve the availability of safe and effective methods of contraception, promote compulsory education among children, and reduce poverty. Rapid and sustained declines in fertility could result in a large labor force relative to the number of children and older people in some period(s), creatin', ' in a large labor force relative to the number of children and older people in some period(s), creating a window of opportunity for socioeconomic growth, commonly known as the “first demographic dividend (population bonus)” ( 9 ). With progress along the demographic transition in a country, the young bulk of the labor force enters the late stages of the labor force. This leads to higher per capita consumption due to this population’s greater resources, and eventually creating another window of opportunity for economic growth in that country, or the “second demographic dividend” ( 9 ). Most developing countries are (or will be) in their first window of opportunity, and many developed countries are (or will be) in their second window of opportunity. However, it should be emphasized that the demographic dividends are opportunities for economic growth and should not be taken for granted. The duration of each window of opportunity is limited and does not last forever. Instead, the realization of demographic divide', \"ow of opportunity is limited and does not last forever. Instead, the realization of demographic dividends depends on appropriate policies adopted in other related sectors and the country’s ability to implement these policies ( 22 ). Research has shown that female labor force participation, educational attainment of the labor force, the potentiality of the old-age population entering the workforce, people's health and wellbeing, urbanization, investments (especially foreign direct invests), high technology, and international trades are all important factors determining the outcomes of demographic dividends ( 22 ). It is thus important for different countries to formulate socioeconomic policy packages that are consistent with their own population trends and characteristics to reap the maximum benefits of the demographic dividends. For countries in the first (window) stage, promoting quality education, enhancing women’s empowerment, creating more jobs, and attracting more foreign direct investments may be a prio\", ' women’s empowerment, creating more jobs, and attracting more foreign direct investments may be a priority. For aging countries, especially aged and super-aged countries, postponing the retirement age, developing a sound long-term care system, promoting home- and community-based social services, and creating social environments without ageism are effective solutions to ensure that all adults achieve healthy aging and age in the right place. However, it is also worth noting that with prolonged life expectancy and improvements in the health of all people, the threshold of old age will likely increase, which means the size, the length, and the timing of these (window) periods could be prolonged. Nevertheless, there are uncertainties in future population growth, not only because there are uncertainties in the future trends for the three demographic components (fertility, mortality, and migration), but also because many other factors can affect a population’s future trajectories. For example, the ongoing coronavir', 'e many other factors can affect a population’s future trajectories. For example, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted almost every nation and profoundly affected every member of a society. By mid-2021, the pandemic has caused more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide — with older people being the hardest hit. The excess deaths across countries range from 5 deaths per million population to more than 1,000 deaths per million population in the past 1.5 years. The lockdown policies implemented in most countries have greatly reduced both internal and international migration; and it may take years to reach pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. For the pandemic’s impact on fertility, it is too early to draw any reliable conclusions at this point. Some evidence suggests that there is an increase in child marriages and adolescent fertility, yet evidence in some countries shows a decrease in fertility in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. Based on historical evidence, we would expect a relative', 'lity in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. Based on historical evidence, we would expect a relatively high level of fertility in the post-disaster or post-pandemic period ( 23 ). The future trends in population growth of a country are also affected by the birth policies of a country. China recently relaxed its birth policies to allow couples to have up to three children ( 24 ). Given its large share of the world’s population, such a relaxation in its birth policy will not only influence China’s own population growth in the future, but also influence the trajectory of the world’s population. In analyzing future population growth, it is crucial to consider the trends in the size and composition of households. With trends toward smaller households in the near future, how to transform our consumption behaviors to ensure a responsible and sustainable consumption pattern towards achieving SDG should be a priority ( 16 ). Furthermore, given the global trends in urbanization, policies to manage urban growth are ne', 'y ( 16 ). Furthermore, given the global trends in urbanization, policies to manage urban growth are needed to ensure equal access to housing, education, healthcare, decent jobs, and friendly living and working environments — with a focus on the needs of the urban poor and other vulnerable groups — so that the benefits of urbanization can be shared by all. Climate change and environmental degradation are major global concerns in the contemporary world. There is a consensus that population growth, urbanization, unsustainable consumption patterns are important drivers of emissions that have been a cause of the worsening climate and ecosystem ( 25 ). Rapid population growth is one of the key drivers of growing emissions and one of the determinants of vulnerability to its impact ( 2 ). Consequently, slowing population growth could be key to lessen climate risks facing human beings by reducing global emissions in the long-term and by freeing up resources for adaptation ( 2 ). In summary, the world’s population is p', 'he long-term and by freeing up resources for adaptation ( 2 ). In summary, the world’s population is projected to grow throughout the century, albeit at a decreasing rate. Given large variations in population trends across countries, different countries should develop sound policies specific to their own situation to scientifically address the unique challenges related to population growth for achieving SDGs and other long-term socioeconomic development goals.

The PMC Single Citation Matcher tool is also available to find PMC articles by specific citation information. Tip: Searches are not case sensitive. Learn to search by: Author | Journal | Collection | Funder | License | Publication Date | PMC Live Date | Article Property Other search topics: Phrase Searching | Truncating Search Terms | Combining Search Terms with Boolean Operators (AND, OR, NOT) By Author In the Search box, enter the author\\'s full name or their last name followed by initials, without punctuation. If you only know the author\\'s last name, use the author search field tag [au] as shown in an example below. Author names are automatically truncated to account for varyin', ' tag [au] as shown in an example below. Author names are automatically truncated to account for varying initials and designations such as Jr. To turn off the truncation, use double quotes around the author\\'s name with the author search field tag [au] as shown in an example below. By Journal In the Search box, enter the journal title, the NLM journal title abbreviation, or the ISSN , the 8-digit standardized international code used to identify journals. Journal Search Tips If a journal title or abbreviation includes a special character (e.g., parentheses, brackets, ampersands), enter the title or abbreviation without the special characters. For complete retrieval of indexed items, we recommend a search using the full journal title or the journal title abbreviation  as older articles may not have an ISSN. If you are searching using the full journal title or title abbreviation in the Search box along with additional search terms, it is helpful to use quotation marks around a journal\\'s title, e.g., obesity \"preve', 'onal search terms, it is helpful to use quotation marks around a journal\\'s title, e.g., obesity \"preventing chronic disease\"[journal] . By Collection Explore the contents of collections in PMC by entering the appropriate preset PMC search filter(s): See PMC Collections for additional information. By Funder Use or append the preset search filters shown in the Search Query column below to find articles supported by funding organizations that have formally partnered with NLM to use PMC as a repository for their funded research. See PMC and Research Funder Policies for additional information. By License Limit your search results to articles in the PMC Open Access Subset with specific Creative Commons (CC) licenses by appending the preset search filters shown in the Search Query column below. For descriptions of these licenses, please see the Creative Commons site, About the Licenses . Please note that not all articles in the Open Access Subset have a CC license. These filters are based on license information, whi', 'icles in the Open Access Subset have a CC license. These filters are based on license information, which is provided to PMC by publishers and other content providers. Please note that, in some cases, there are discrepancies between these machine-readable identifiers and the actual text of the license statements. In 2013, PMC instituted new rules to help ensure consistency of the tagging of the licenses , which apply to all content received since then. By Publication Date Enter dates into the Search box using the format YYYY/MM/DD[ pubdate ], or enter a date range using a colon (:) between each date followed by a date search field tag. By PMC Live Date Enter dates into the Search box using the format YYYY/MM/DD[ pmclivedate ], or enter a date range using a colon (:) between each date followed by a date search field tag. If you are looking for the PMC Live Date for a specific record, See the corresponding PubMed record for the PMC release date of embargoed articles.

Deposit date data are not available. By Article Property Search or append a search with any of the following queries to find articles with these specific properties in PMC: Phrase Searching PMC does not perform adjacency searching. However, many phrases are recognized by the MeSH Translation Table used in PMC\\'s automatic term mapping feature. For example, if you enter “influenza in birds”, PMC recognizes this phrase as a MeSH concept. If a phrase is not recognized, you can instruct PMC to bypass automatic term mapping and search for a specific phrase using the following formats: Enclose the phrase in double quotes: \"kidney allograft\" . When you enter your search terms as a phrase (using quotation mark', 'double quotes: \"kidney allograft\" . When you enter your search terms as a phrase (using quotation marks), PMC will not perform automatic term mapping, which includes expansion of MeSH terms . Use a search tag : kidney allograft[tw] Use a hyphen instead of a space: \" first-line \" Phrases may appear in a PMC article but not be in the phrases index. To browse indexed phrases, use the Show Index feature included in the Advanced Search Builder: select a search field, enter the beginning of a phrase, and then click Show Index. Truncating Search Terms To search for all terms that begin with a word, enter the word followed by an asterisk (*). For example, flavor* finds terms that begin with the root term flavor, such as flavored, flavorful, flavoring, etc. PMC searches for the first 600 variations of a truncated term. If a truncated term (e.g., \"tox*\") produces more than 600 variations, PMC displays a warning message to lengthen the root word to search for all endings. Truncation turns off automatic term mapping and ', ' to lengthen the root word to search for all endings. Truncation turns off automatic term mapping and the automatic expansion of a MeSH term . Truncating a word in a multi-word query may result in an unexpected phrase search. For example, the search fetus infection* maternal will treat fetus infection* as a phrase. Truncation stops at the end of a term, that is, it does not process beyond a space. Combining Search Terms with Boolean Operators (AND, OR, NOT) Enter Boolean operators in uppercase characters to combine or exclude search terms: AND retrieves results that include all of the search terms. OR retrieves results that include at least one of the search terms. NOT excludes the retrieval of terms from your search. Use parentheses to group terms as desired. Search Tips for Boolean Operators Combine Tagged Search Terms Using Boolean Operators Boolean operators must be used when combining tagged search terms . \"smith j\"[au] AND 2001:2021[pubdate] Stop Automatic Term Mapping Using Boolean Operators In a multi', ' . \"smith j\"[au] AND 2001:2021[pubdate] Stop Automatic Term Mapping Using Boolean Operators In a multi-word search entered without Boolean operators, PMC will use automatic term mapping to identify concepts. air bladder fistula Automatic term mapping will be used, so the search results will include articles that have the term \"air bladder\" and the word \"fistula\" , because \"air bladder\" is a term recognized by PMC\\'s automatic term mapping. air AND bladder AND fistula Automatic term mapping will not be used. The search results will include articles with the separate words \"air\", \"bladder\", and \"fistula\" found in them. View Search Results PMC search results are displayed by default in order of relevance with 20 results per page. The default sort order for search results is based on an algorithm that analyzes the full text of every PMC article that contains any of your search terms. For a given search query, \"weight\" is calculated for each article depending on how many search terms are found, which fields they ar', 'ght\" is calculated for each article depending on how many search terms are found, which fields they are found in, and the size of the article. Although recently-published articles are given more weight, this is not a major sorting factor. Learn to: Understand the Search Results Page | Customize Your Search Results Display | View and Edit Search Details | Save and Email Search Results and Searches Understand the Search Results Page From the search results page you can Click on the record title to access an article Access the article directly in one of two different formats ( HTML Article View or PDF - More about formats can be found at View an Article ).

Sometimes these changes may not match what you have in mind. For example, if you search for cyst', 'eval. Sometimes these changes may not match what you have in mind. For example, if you search for cystic fibrosis by its abbreviation cf, the cf search retrieves some articles that do not discuss cystic fibrosis. To see why PMC retrieved these articles, review the Search Details box to see how PMC translated cf to search for articles about cerebrospinal fluid or cf. (For additional information, see automatic term mapping and search rules .) Edit the search in the Search Details box by adding or deleting terms and then click the Search button just below the box. Click on \"See more…\" to see more detailed information about the query used to run the search as shown in the screenshot below. From the Search Details window you can: Edit the search in the Query Translation box by adding or deleting terms and then click the Search button.

Click Manage Filters in the right-hand Filter your results portlet to customize your My NCBI filter selections . (For details on using Filters in My NCBI, see Working with Filters in My NCBI Help ). Details on setting up your own filters can be found in the Creating Custom Filters section.) Save and Email Results and Searches PMC offers a wide variety of methods to save search results. Use the Send to dropdown in order to: Save results to a file (may take several minutes for a large retrieval). The default for the Send to File feature is to save the entire retrieval unless you select specific results. Send results by e-mail. You may email up to 200 items at a time to a single email address. Your PMC results will be sent from the NCBI automatic mail server, sent by Entrez [nobody@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]. Do not reply to this message. This i', ' automatic mail server, sent by Entrez [nobody@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]. Do not reply to this message. This is not a functioning customer service email address. Save results to a RSS feed. PMC does not currently support RSS feeds directly through the PMC search page. However, in PubMed you can create an RSS feed by using a search that restricts retrieval to the PMC subset if you include AND pubmed pmc[sb] in the query. Documentation is also available for creating a permalink in PubMed . Note: Some PMC article types are not accepted by PubMed and so will not be included in the RSS feed. Save results temporarily in your Clipboard. The Clipboard gives you a place to collect selected results from one or several searches. The Clipboard will be lost after 8 hours of inactivity on PMC or on any of the other Entrez databases. Save results permanently in My NCBI Collection s (you must be signed in to My NCBI to use this feature). There is no limit to the number of collections you may store in My NCBI. In addition, collection', 'ure). There is no limit to the number of collections you may store in My NCBI. In addition, collections can be made public to share with others. (See My NCBI Help Collections for more information.) Clipboard Tips The maximum number of items that can be placed in the Clipboard is 500. If you select Clipboard from the Send to menu without selecting results using the check box, PMC will add all (up to 500 results) of your search results to the Clipboard. Adding the same article to the Clipboard multiple times will not result in duplicate entries in the Clipboard. PMC uses cookies to add your selections to the Clipboard. For you to use this feature, your Web browser must be set to accept cookies. Results in the Clipboard are represented by the search number #0, which may be used in Boolean search statements. For example, to limit the results you have collected in the Clipboard to author manuscripts, use the following search: “#0 AND author manuscript [filter]”. This does not affect or replace the Clipboard conten', 'wing search: “#0 AND author manuscript [filter]”. This does not affect or replace the Clipboard contents. Use Advanced Search Tools included on the Advanced Search page help users to: search for terms in a specific field, combine searches and build large, complex search strings, and compare the number of results for different queries. A link to the Advanced Search page is available by the search box. Learn to: Search by a Specific Field | Browse the Index of Terms | View Your Search History Search by a Specific Field From the \"All Fields\" drop-down menu, select the field you would like to search. Add terms from the builder to the query box to construct your search. The default Boolean operator is AND; if desired, choose OR or NOT from the pull-down menu.

To turn off this automatic feature, use the search syntax [sh:noexp], e.g., \"therapy [sh:noexp]\". In addition, you can enter the MEDLINE two-letter ', 'arch syntax [sh:noexp], e.g., \"therapy [sh:noexp]\". In addition, you can enter the MEDLINE two-letter MeSH Subheading abbreviations rather than spelling out the Subheading (e.g., dh[sh] = diet therapy [sh]). See PubMed Help: MeSH Subheadings for a full list of abbreviations. MeSH Terms [mh] or [MeSH Terms] NLM\\'s Medical Subject Headings controlled vocabulary of biomedical terms that is used to describe the subject of each journal article in MEDLINE. MeSH contains more than 23,000 terms and is updated annually to reflect changes in medicine and medical terminology. MeSH terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. Entrez allows you to view this hierarchy and select terms for searching in the MeSH database . Skilled subject analysts examine journal articles and assign to each the most specific MeSH terms applicable, typically 10 to 12. Applying the MeSH vocabulary ensures that articles are uniformly indexed by subject, whatever the author\\'s wor', ' the MeSH vocabulary ensures that articles are uniformly indexed by subject, whatever the author\\'s words. Notes on MeSH Terms and Major MeSH Topic Search Fields: To search the term only as a MeSH term, it must be tagged using the search field, e.g., [mh] for MeSH Terms or [majr] for MeSH Major Topic. A tagged term is checked against the PMC MeSH translation table and mapped to the appropriate MeSH term. Some concepts may map to two or more MeSH terms. To turn off this mapping, enclose the MeSH term in double quotes and tag with [mh], e.g., \"cold\"[mh]. MeSH terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. MeSH terms in PMC automatically include the more specific MeSH terms in a search. For more detailed information about MeSH vocabulary including the hierarchical structure, please see the MeSH home page . MeSH/Subheading Combinations: To directly attach MeSH subheadings, use the format MeSH Term/Subheading, e.g., \"neoplasms/diet therapy\". You may ', 'attach MeSH subheadings, use the format MeSH Term/Subheading, e.g., \"neoplasms/diet therapy\". You may also use the MEDLINE two-letter MeSH subheading abbreviations, e.g., neoplasms/dh. The [mh] tag is not required, however [majr] may be used, e.g., \"plants/genetics[majr]\". Only one subheading may be directly attached to a MeSH term. For a MeSH/Subheading combination, PMC always includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms for the MeSH term and also includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader subheadings. The broader subheading, or one of its subheadings, will be directly attached to the MeSH term or one of its subheadings. For example, \"hypertension/therapy\" also retrieves \"hypertension/diet therapy\"; \"hypertension/drug therapy\"; \"hypertension, malignant/therapy\"; \"hypertension, malignant/drug therapy\", and so on, as well as \"hypertension/therapy\". To turn off the automatic inclusion of the more specific terms, use the syntax [field:noexp], e.g., hypertension[mh:noexp], or hyp', 'clusion of the more specific terms, use the syntax [field:noexp], e.g., hypertension[mh:noexp], or hypertension[majr:noexp], or hypertension/therapy[mh:noexp]. The latter example turns off the more specific terms in both parts, searching for only the one Subheading therapy attached directly to only the one MeSH term hypertension. MeSH terms can be selected for searching in the drop-down menu in the Advanced Search Builder . Methods - Key Terms [meth] Key terms from the methods section of the article abstract. Organism [orgn] Contains the scientific and common names for the organisms in the NCBI taxonomy database that are found in PMC articles. The NCBI taxonomy database only includes species that are represented in the public sequence databases, so many of the organisms mentioned in PMC articles will not be found in this index. To cut down on false hits, matches to scientific names are required to add PMC articles to this index - common names in this field will only retrieve articles that mention the correspo', 'icles to this index - common names in this field will only retrieve articles that mention the corresponding scientific name. By default, the PMC organism search is \"unexpanded\" and does not include more specific terms. The query mammalia[orgn] will only retrieve articles that explicitly mention mammalia. The query mammalia[orgn:exp] will retrieve articles that mention any of the species of mammals. Organism Unsynonymized [orgn_nosyn] Organism names that are identified as synonyms in the NCBI taxonomy database will retrieve the same set of articles in the PMC Organism index (e.g., \"Danio rerio[orgn]\" = \"Brachydanio rerio[orgn]\"). The Organism unsynonymized index will only retrieve articles that use the exact name as given. Pagination [pg] Enter only the first page number on which the article appears. The result will display the full pagination of the article, but this field is searchable using only the first page number. PMC Live Date [pmclivedate] Date the article was first available in PMC. Dates or date ran', 'age number. PMC Live Date [pmclivedate] Date the article was first available in PMC. Dates or date ranges must be entered using the format YYYY/MM/DD, e.g. \"2021/04/06[pmclivedate]\". The month and day are optional (e.g., \"2021[pmclivedate]\" or \"2021/03[pmclivedate]\"). To enter a date range, insert a colon (:) between each date (e.g., \"2020:2021[pmclivedate]\" or \"2021/01:2021/04[pmclivedate]\"). Publication Date [pubdate] The date that the article was published. Dates or date ranges must be searched using the format YYYY/MM/DD, e.g. \"1998/03/06[pubdate]\". The month and day are optional (e.g., \"2021[pubdate]\" or \"2021/03[pubdate]\"). To enter a date range, insert a colon (:) between each date (e.g., \"2019:2021[pubdate]\" or \"2021/01:2021/04[pubdate]\"). Use the following format to search X days, months, or years immediately preceding today\\'s date where X = numeric value: \"last X days\"[pubdate] \"last X months\"[pubdate] \"last X year\"[pubdate] Tip: The display of the publication date depends on the publication format ', 'te] \"last X year\"[pubdate] Tip: The display of the publication date depends on the publication format of the journal (e.g., electronic, print). Some journals include just the year, whereas others include the year plus month or year plus month plus day. Some journals use the year and season (e.g., Winter 2021). The publication date in the citation is recorded as it is provided to PMC from the publisher. It is recommended that you search only by year (e.g., \"2021[pubdate]\" or \"2019:2021[pubdate]\"). PubMed ID [pmid] Unique identifier for the PubMed record for a PMC article. Reference [refr] Includes words and numbers in the titles in an article references section. Reference Author [refa] Includes authors cited in an article references section.\\nPMC references do not list the full author name. The format to search for a reference author is the same as article Author searching. Section Title [sect] Includes words and numbers in an article section title. Supplementary Concept [nm] Includes chemical, protocol or dise', 'nd numbers in an article section title. Supplementary Concept [nm] Includes chemical, protocol or disease terms. Synonyms to the supplementary concepts will automatically map when tagged with [nm]. This field was implemented in mid-1980; however, many chemical names are searchable as MeSH terms before that date. Text Word [tw] or [Text Word] Includes all words and numbers in the title, abstract and article body, as well as in table and figure captions and in the article reference section. Title [ti] Words and numbers included in the title of an article. Volume [vi] The number of the journal volume in which an article is published. Appendices Automatic Term Mapping | Stopwords | Translation Tables | Author Index | Cookies | Character Conversions | PMC URL Format Automatic Term Mapping Terms not followed by a Search field tag that are entered in the Search box are matched (in this order) against the PMC MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) translation table , the Journals translation table , the Full Author translat', 'edical Subject Headings) translation table , the Journals translation table , the Full Author translation table , and the Author index . When a match is found for a term or phrase in a translation table the mapping process is complete and does not continue to the next translation table. Tips: If no match is found, PMC breaks apart the phrase and repeats the automatic term mapping process until a match is found. PMC ignores stopwords in searches. See PubMed Help: Stopwords for a full list of stopwords. If there is still no match, the individual terms will be combined (with AND) and searched for in all fields. See the Search details box to verify how your terms are translated. Report Problems with Automatic Term Mapping: If you want to report a translation that does not seem accurate for your search topic, please write to the PMC Help Desk with the information. Stopwords PMC searches use the same stopwords that are used in PubMed. Stopwords are common, but uninformative words such as \"a\" or \"about\" that are eli', ' are used in PubMed. Stopwords are common, but uninformative words such as \"a\" or \"about\" that are eliminated from searches. See PubMed Stopwords for the list. Translation Tables Automatic term mapping makes use of three translation tables MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) translation table , a Journals translation table , the Full Author translation table . PMC MeSH Translation Table The PMC MeSH translation table contains: MeSH terms The See-Reference mappings (also known as entry terms) for MeSH terms MeSH Subheadings Terms derived from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) that have equivalent synonyms or lexical variants in English Supplementary concept (substance) names and their synonyms If a match is found in this translation table, the term will be searched as MeSH (which includes the MeSH term and any specific terms indented under that term in the MeSH hierarchy ), and in all fields. For example, if you enter \"vitamin c\" (without quotes) in the query box, PMC will translate this search to: \"ascor', ' if you enter \"vitamin c\" (without quotes) in the query box, PMC will translate this search to: \"ascorbic acid\"[MeSH Terms] OR vitamin c[Text Word] Journals Translation Table The Journals translation table contains: full journal title title abbreviation ISSN number These will automatically map to the journal abbreviation that is used to search journals in PMC. For example, if you enter the journal title \"annals of botany\" (without quotes) in the PMC Search box and check the Search details you will see it translate to: \\'\"Ann Bot\"[Journal] OR \"annals of botany\"[All Fields]\\' Full Author Translation Table The Full Author translation table contains full author names from all articles for which full names are provided to PMC from the publisher. Tips: A comma following the last name for searching is optional. For some names, however, it is necessary to distinguish which name is the last name by using the comma following the last name, e.g., \"james, ryan\". Omit periods after initials and put all suffixes at the end, ', 'wing the last name, e.g., \"james, ryan\". Omit periods after initials and put all suffixes at the end, e.g., vollmer charles jr Initials and suffixes are not required. If you include a middle initial or suffix, you will only retrieve results for articles that were published using the middle initial or suffix. To distinguish author initials that may match a full author name use the [fau] search tag, e.g., \"peterson do[fau]\". Author Index If the term is not found in the PMC MeSH translation table or the Journals translation table and is not a single term, PMC checks the author index for a match. When combining multiple authors, to avoid a match with full author names, include initials or use the [au] search tag , e.g., ryan[au] AND james[au].

In general, the first URL path segment will identify the resource type. Subsequent path segments identify the specific resource, and sometimes sub-resources. Query string parameters are used to filter or refine results, and to specify the response format. In many cases, there are multiple URLs that will access the same resource. In these cases, we identify one as the canonical URL (shown bold in the table below), and use of the ancillary URLs will cause a redirect to the canonical one.

For example, suppose you have a one-to-one relationship between the Employees and Employee Benefits tables. If an employee leaves the company and you remove them from your Employees table, the related employee record in the Employee Benefits table is removed, too. Sometimes enforcing referential integrity doesn’t make sense. For example, suppose you have a one-to-many relationship between Shippers and Orders. You delete a shipper, and that shipper maps to orders in the Orders table. Those orders become orphans, meaning that they still contain a Shipper ID, but the ID is no longer valid because the record that it references no longer exists.\\n Cascade Update Related Fields                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       To make sure that data in related fields is updated in all the related tables, select this. For example, suppose you simply want to change the ID of a shipper. Setting this option ensures that the Shipper ID is updated—not just in the Shipper table but also in any other tables connected to it that also include that Shipper ID, such as the Orders table.\\nCascade Delete Related Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The decision to select this depends on whether you need to retain records in some tables even though they might be deleted from other tables. For example, suppose you delete a shipper. If this option is selected, Access deletes all records in all tables that reference that Shipper ID, including all orders (in the Orders table) shipped by that shipper.

The power of a relational database lies in combining data across tables. To do that, you first need to establish relationships between your tables. Then, put Access to work to combine data in queries, forms, and reports. To see all existing relationships defined for a database, open an Access template, go to the Database Tools tab, and select Relationships . Note: If you open a blank database or haven’t defined any table relationships, Access prompts you to add a table or query. Before you can add a relationship, you need at least two tables. Ideally, you build all', 'able or query. Before you can add a relationship, you need at least two tables. Ideally, you build all of your tables first. To learn more, see Create relationships with the Lookup Wizard and Create relationships with the Relationships Pane . Understanding the Relationships view The lines in the Relationships view indicate connections between the tables. In the following image, the table on the left is the parent table. The table on the right is the child table. The line between them connects the fields (in this case, Order ID and Product ID) used to match data. Lines and symbols show you how your tables are related: A thick connecting line means you’re enforcing referential data integrity. That’s good. It keeps your data synced. In our illustration, the number 1 indicates that there can be only one matching record in that table. In the Orders table shown here, only one record matches each order. The ∞ symbol indicates that many records can include the same ID. In the Order Details table shown here, an order ', ' indicates that many records can include the same ID. In the Order Details table shown here, an order (indicated by its order ID) may appear more than once, because the same order may include multiple products. Types of relationships between tables There are three types of relationships between tables: One-to-one . When each item in each table only appears once. For example, each employee can have only one company car to use. For more information, see Create one-to-one relationships . One-to-many . When one item in one table can have a relationship to multiple items in another table. For example, each purchase order can include multiple products. Many-to-many . When one or more items in one table can have a relationship to one or more items in another table. For example, each order can have multiple products, and each product can appear on many orders. To find out more, see Create many-to-many relationships . One-to-many relationships One of the most common relationships between tables in well-designed databa', ' One-to-many relationships One of the most common relationships between tables in well-designed databases is the one-to-many relationship. Relationships between tables normally rely on the primary key in one of the tables. Recall that the primary key is a unique identifier (often numeric) for each record. To show that the information in two different tables is related, you usually create a relationship using the primary key from one of the tables. In the relationship shown here, for example, each person in the Contacts table has an ID, which is the primary key (indicated by the key symbol next to it). That ID also appears in the Owner field in the Assets table. To email the person associated with an asset, get the value from the Email Address field. To do so, look for the value in the Owner field of the Asset table and then search for that ID in the Contacts table. The number 1 at one end of the connecting line and the ∞ symbol at the other end indicate that this is a one-to-many relationship, so one contact ', 'ne and the ∞ symbol at the other end indicate that this is a one-to-many relationship, so one contact might be associated with many assets. Edit a relationship If you are modifying an existing database or if you created your database from a template, you can edit the existing relationships to meet your needs. Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . On the Design tab, select Edit Relationships . Table/Query is the parent table on the left (in this example, Customers). Related Table/Query is the child table (in this example, Orders). Even if the tables don’t appear in this order in the Relationships view, their placement in the dialog box indicates the direction of the line connecting them and the relationship. That’s impo', 'n the dialog box indicates the direction of the line connecting them and the relationship. That’s important if, for example, it’s a one-to-many relationship, because it indicates that the table on the left is the one (the parent table) and the table on the right is the many (the child table). To change the fields that connect the tables, select a different field below each table shown. In this example, the ID field in the Customers table connects to the Customer ID field in the Orders table. Change the way Access synchronizes your data between tables. To change the relationship between the tables from an inner join to an outer join, select the Join Type button. For more information, see Create queries with outer joins . Delete a table relationship Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. To remove a table relationship: Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting the two related tables. Tip: If you don’t s', 'atabase Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting the two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . Select the Delete key. If you’re prompted to verify that you want to delete the relationship, select Yes . Note: When you remove a relationship, you also remove referential integrity support for that relationship, if any. As a result, Access will no longer prevent changes that result in orphan records on the many side of a one-to-many relationship. Want more? Create, edit or delete a relationship Need more help?

Less When you create an Excel table , Excel assigns a name to the table, and to each column header in the table. When you add formulas to an Exc', \"l assigns a name to the table, and to each column header in the table. When you add formulas to an Excel table, those names can appear automatically as you enter the formula and select the cell references in the table instead of manually entering them. Here's an example of what Excel does: That combination of table and column names is called a structured reference. The names in structured references adjust whenever you add or remove data from the table. Structured references also appear when you create a formula outside of an Excel table that references table data. The references can make it easier to locate tables in a large workbook. To include structured references in your formula, click the table cells you want to reference instead of typing their cell reference in the formula. Let’s use the following example data to enter a formula that automatically uses structured references to calculate the amount of a sales commission. Copy the sample data in the table above, including the column headings, and paste \", 'a sales commission. Copy the sample data in the table above, including the column headings, and paste it into cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet. To create the table, select any cell within the data range, and press Ctrl+T . Make sure the My table has headers box is checked, and click OK . In cell E2, type an equal sign ( = ), and click cell C2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[Sales Amount]] appears after the equal sign. Type an asterisk ( * ) directly after the closing bracket, and click cell D2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[% Commission]] appears after the asterisk. Press Enter . Excel automatically creates a calculated column and copies the formula down the entire column for you, adjusting it for each row. What happens when I use explicit cell references? If you enter explicit cell references in a calculated column, it can be harder to see what the formula is calculating. In your sample worksheet, click cell E2 In the formula bar, enter =C2*D2 and press Enter . Notice that ', 'n your sample worksheet, click cell E2 In the formula bar, enter =C2*D2 and press Enter . Notice that while Excel copies your formula down the column, it doesn\\'t use structured references. If, for example, you add a column between the existing columns C and D, you\\'d have to revise your formula. How do I change a table name? When you create an Excel table, Excel creates a default table name (Table1, Table2, and so on), but you can change the table name to make it more meaningful. Select any cell in the table to show the Table Tools > Design tab on the ribbon. Type the name you want in the Table Name box, and press Enter . In our example data, we used the name DeptSales . Use the following rules for table names: Use valid characters Always start a name with a letter, an underscore character ( _ ), or a backslash ( \\\\ ). Use letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters for the rest of the name. You can’t use \"C\", \"c\", \"R\", or \"r\" for the name, because they’re already designated as a shortcut for selecting', 'use \"C\", \"c\", \"R\", or \"r\" for the name, because they’re already designated as a shortcut for selecting the column or row for the active cell when you enter them in the Name or Go To box. Don’t use cell references Names can’t be the same as a cell reference, such as Z$100 or R1C1. Don’t use a space to separate words Spaces can’t be used in the name. You can use the underscore character ( _ ) and period ( . ) as word separators. For example, DeptSales, Sales_Tax or First.Quarter. Use no more than 255 characters A table name can have up to 255 characters. Use unique table names Duplicate names aren’t allowed. Excel doesn’t distinguish between upper and lowercase characters in names so if you enter “Sales” but already have another name called “SALES\" in the same workbook, you’ll be prompted to choose a unique name. Use an object identifier If you plan on having a mix of tables, PivotTables and charts, it\\'s a good idea to prefix your names with the object type. For example: tbl_Sales for a sales table, pt_Sales fo', ' idea to prefix your names with the object type. For example: tbl_Sales for a sales table, pt_Sales for a sales PivotTable, and chrt_Sales for a sales chart, or ptchrt_Sales for a sales PivotChart. This keeps all of your names in an ordered list in the Name Manager . Structured reference syntax rules You can also enter or change structured references manually in the formula but to do that, it will help to understand structured reference syntax. Let’s go over the following formula example: =SUM(DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]],DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]]) This formula has the following structured reference components: Table name: DeptSales is a custom table name. It references the table data, without any header or total rows. You can use a default table name, such as Table1, or change it to use a custom name. Column specifier: [Sales Amount] and [Commission Amount ] are column specifiers that use the names of the columns they represent. They reference the column data, without any column header or', ' the names of the columns they represent. They reference the column data, without any column header or total row. Always enclose specifiers in brackets as shown. Item specifier: [#Totals] and [#Data] are special item specifiers that refer to specific portions of the table, such as the total row. Table specifier: [[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and [[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are table specifiers that represent the outer portions of the structured reference. Outer references follow the table name, and you enclose them in square brackets. Structured reference: (DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are structured references, represented by a string that begins with the table name and ends with the column specifier. To create or edit structured references manually, use these syntax rules: Use brackets around specifiers All table, column, and special item specifiers need to be enclosed in matching brackets ([ ]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer match', \"e enclosed in matching brackets ([ ]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer matching brackets to enclose the inner matching brackets of the other specifiers. For example: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All column headers are text strings But they don’t require quotes when they’re used in a structured reference. Numbers or dates, such as 2014 or 1/1/2014, are also considered text strings. You can’t use expressions with column headers. For example, the expression DeptSalesFYSummary[[2014]:[2012]] won’t work. Use brackets around column headers with special characters If there are special characters, the entire column header needs to be enclosed in brackets, which means that double brackets are required in a column specifier. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[[Total $ Amount]] Here’s the list of special characters that need extra brackets in the formula: Tab Line feed Carriage return Comma (,) Colon (:) Period (.) Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign (#) Single quotation mark (')\", 'a (,) Colon (:) Period (.) Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign (#) Single quotation mark (\\') Double quotation mark (\") Left brace ({) Right brace (}) Dollar sign ($) Caret (^) Ampersand (&) Asterisk (*) Plus sign (+) Equal sign (=) Minus sign (-) Greater than symbol (>) Less than symbol (<) Division sign (/) At sign (@) Backslash (\\\\) Exclamation point (!) Left parenthesis (() Right parenthesis ()) Percent sign (%) Question mark (?) Backtick (`) Semicolon (;) Tilde (~) Underscore (_) Use an escape character for some special characters in column headers Some characters have special meaning and require the use of a single quotation mark (\\') as an escape character. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[\\'#OfItems] Here’s the list of special characters that need an escape character (\\') in the formula: Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign(#) Single quotation mark (\\') At sign (@) Use the space character to improve readability in a structured reference You can use space characters to improve the readabil', ' to improve readability in a structured reference You can use space characters to improve the readability of a structured reference. For example: =DeptSales[ [Sales Person]:[Region] ] or =DeptSales[[#Headers], [#Data], [% Commission]] It’s recommended to use one space: After the first left bracket ([) Preceding the last right bracket (]). After a comma. Reference operators For more flexibility in specifying ranges of cells, you can use the following reference operators to combine column specifiers. Special item specifiers To refer to specific portions of a table, such as just the totals row, you can use any of the following special item specifiers in your structured references. Qualifying structured references in calculated columns When you create a calculated column, you often use a structured reference to create the formula. This structured reference can be unqualified or fully qualified. For example, to create the calculated column, called Commission Amount, that calculates the amount of commission in doll', 'eate the calculated column, called Commission Amount, that calculates the amount of commission in dollars, you can use the following formulas: The general rule to follow is this: If you’re using structured references within a table, such as when you create a calculated column, you can use an unqualified structured reference, but if you use the structured reference outside of the table, you need to use a fully qualified structured reference. Examples of using structured references Here are some ways to use structured references. Strategies for working with structured references Consider the following when you work with structured references. Use Formula AutoComplete You may find that using Formula AutoComplete is very useful when you enter structured references and to ensure the use of correct syntax. For more information, see Use Formula AutoComplete . Decide whether to generate structured references for tables in semi-selections By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi', 'es in semi-selections By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi-selects the cells and automatically enters a structured reference instead of the cell range in the formula. This semi-selection behavior makes it much easier to enter a structured reference. You can turn this behavior on or off by selecting or clearing the Use table names in formulas check box in the File > Options > Formulas > Working with formulas dialog. Use workbooks with external links to Excel tables in other workbooks If a workbook contains an external link to an Excel table in another workbook, that linked source workbook must be open in Excel to avoid #REF! errors in the destination workbook that contains the links. If you open the destination workbook first and #REF! errors appear, they will be resolved if you then open the source workbook. If you open the source workbook first, you should see no error codes. Convert a range to a table and a table to a range When you convert a table to a range, all', 'rror codes. Convert a range to a table and a table to a range When you convert a table to a range, all cell references change to their equivalent absolute A1 style references. When you convert a range to a table, Excel doesn’t automatically change any cell references of this range to their equivalent structured references. Turn off column headers You can toggle table column headers on and off from the table Design tab > Header Row . If you turn off table column headers, structured references that use column names aren’t affected, and you can still use them in formulas. Structured references that refer directly to the table headers (e.g. =DeptSales[[#Headers],[%Commission]] ) will result in #REF . Add or delete columns and rows to the table Because table data ranges often change, cell references for structured references adjust automatically. For example, if you use a table name in a formula to count all the data cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts. Rename', 'ata cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts. Rename a table or column If you rename a column or table, Excel automatically changes the use of that table and column header in all structured references that are used in the workbook. Move, copy, and fill structured references All structured references remain the same when you copy or move a formula that uses a structured reference. Note: Copying a structured reference and doing a fill of a structured reference are not the same thing. When you copy, all the structured references remain the same, while when you fill a formula, fully qualified structured references adjust the column specifiers like a series as summarized in the following table.

Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less You can merge (combine) rows from one table into another simply by pasting the data in the first empty cells below the target table. The table will increase in size to include the new rows. If the rows in both tables match up, you can merge t', 'le will increase in size to include the new rows. If the rows in both tables match up, you can merge the columns of one table with another—by pasting them in the first empty cells to the right of the table. In this case also, the table will increase to accommodate the new columns. Merging rows is actually quite simple, but merging columns can be tricky if the rows of one table don\\'t correspond with the rows in the other table. By using VLOOKUP , you can avoid some of the alignment problems. Merge two tables using the VLOOKUP function In the example shown below, you\\'ll see two tables that previously had other names to new names: \"Blue\" and \"Orange.\" In the Blue table, each row is a line item for an order. So, Order ID 20050 has two items, Order ID 20051 has one item, Order ID 20052 has three items, and so on. We want to merge the Sales ID and Region columns with the Blue table, based on matching values in the Order ID columns of the Orange table. Order ID values repeat in the Blue table, but Order ID values in', \"Order ID columns of the Orange table. Order ID values repeat in the Blue table, but Order ID values in the Orange table are unique. If we were to simply copy-and-paste the data from the Orange table, the Sales ID and Region values for the second line item of order 20050 would be off by one row, which would change\\xa0the values in the new columns in the Blue table. Here's the data for the Blue table, which you can copy into a blank worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the Excel table Blue. Here's the data for the Orange table. Copy it into the same worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the table Orange. We need to ensure that the Sales ID and Region values for each order align correctly\\xa0with each unique order line item. To do this, let's paste the table headings Sales ID and Region into the cells to the right of the Blue table, and use VLOOKUP formulas to get the correct value\", 'egion into the cells to the right of the Blue table, and use VLOOKUP formulas to get the correct values from the Sales ID and Region columns of the Orange table. Here\\'s how: Copy the headings Sales ID and Region in the Orange table (only those two cells). Paste the headings into the cell, to the right of the Product ID heading of the Blue table. Now, the Blue table is five columns wide, including the new Sales ID and Region columns. In the Blue table, in the first cell beneath Sales ID, start writing this formula: =VLOOKUP( In the Blue table, pick the first cell in the Order ID column, 20050. The partially completed formula looks like this: The [@[Order ID]] part means \"get the value in this same row from the Order ID column.\" Type a comma, and select the entire Orange table with your mouse so that \"Orange[#All]\" is added to the formula. Type another comma, 2, another comma, and 0—like this: ,2,0 Press Enter, and the completed formula looks like this: The Orange[#All] part means \"look in all the cells in the ', ' and the completed formula looks like this: The Orange[#All] part means \"look in all the cells in the Orange table.\" The 2 means \"get the value from the second column,\" and the 0 means \"return the value only if there\\'s an exact match.\" Notice that Excel filled the cells down in that column, using the VLOOKUP formula. Return to step 3, but this time start writing the same formula in the first cell beneath Region. In step 6, replace 2 with 3, so the completed formula looks like this: There\\'s just one difference between this formula and the first formula—the first gets values from column 2 of the Orange table, and the second gets them from column 3. Now you\\'ll see values in every cell of the new columns in the Blue table. They contain VLOOKUP formulas, but they\\'ll show the values. You\\'ll want to convert the VLOOKUP formulas in those cells to their actual values. Select all the value cells in the Sales ID column, and press Ctrl+C to copy them. Click Home > arrow below Paste . In the Paste gallery, click Paste Val', ' and press Ctrl+C to copy them. Click Home > arrow below Paste . In the Paste gallery, click Paste Values . Select all the value cells in the Region column, copy them, and repeat steps 10 and 11. Now the VLOOKUP formulas in the two columns have been replaced with the values.

Less When you are working with relational data (related data that is stored in separate tables) in Access, you often need to view multiple tables or queries on the same form. For example, you might want to see customer data from one table and information about customer orders from another table at the same time. Subforms are a convenient tool for doing this, and Access provides several ways to help you create subforms quickly. What do you want to do? Learn about subforms Create or add a subform Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Open a subform in a new window in Design view Change the default view of a subform Add related data to a form without creating a subform Learn about subforms A subform is a form that is inserted in another form. The primary form is called the main form, and the form that is enclosed in form is called the subform. A form/subform combi', 'alled the main form, and the form that is enclosed in form is called the subform. A form/subform combination is sometimes referred to as a hierarchical form, a master/detail form, or a parent/child form. Subforms are especially effective when you want to show data from tables or queries that have a one-to-many relationship. A one-to-many relationship is an association between two tables in which the primary key value of each record in the primary table corresponds to the value in the matching field or fields of many records in the related table. For example, you can create a form that displays employee data, and contains a subform that displays each employee\\'s orders. The data in the Employees table is the \"one\" side of the relationship. The data in the Orders table is the \"many\" side of the relationship\\xa0— each employee can have more than one order. 1. The main form shows data from the \"one\" side of the relationship. 2. The subform shows data from the \"many\" side of the relationship. The main form and subform', 'ionship. 2. The subform shows data from the \"many\" side of the relationship. The main form and subform in this kind of form are linked so that the subform displays only records that are related to the current record in the main form. For example, when the main form displays Nancy Freehafer\\'s information, the subform displays only her orders. If the form and subform were unlinked, the subform would display all the orders, not just Nancy\\'s. The following table defines some of the terminology that is associated with subforms. Access will handle most of the details if you use the procedures in this article, but it is helpful to know what is occurring behind the scenes if you need to make modifications later. Notes: For best results, establish table relationships before following the procedures in this article. This enables Access to automatically create the links between subforms and main forms. To view, add, or modify relationships between the tables in your database, on the Database Tools tab, in the Relationsh', 'modify relationships between the tables in your database, on the Database Tools tab, in the Relationships group, click Relationships . When a subform control has a form as its source object, it contains the fields that you place on the form, and it can be viewed as a single form, continuous form, or datasheet. One advantage of basing a subform on a form object is that you can add calculated fields to the subform, such as [Quantity] * [Unit price] . You can insert a datasheet or pivot view into a form by creating a subform control whose source object is a table or query. For more information, see the section Add related data to a form without creating a subform . Top of Page Create or add a subform Use the following table to determine which procedure is most appropriate for your situation. Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard This procedure creates a new form and subform combination by using the Form Wizard. This is also the quickest way to get started if you have not already created ', 'y using the Form Wizard. This is also the quickest way to get started if you have not already created the forms that you want to use as the main form or the subform. On the Create tab, in the Forms group, click Form Wizard . On the first page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select a table or query. For this example, to create an Employees form that displays orders for each employee in a subform, we will select Table: Employees (the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Note: It does not matter which table or query you choose first. Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. On the same page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select another table or query from the list. For this example, we will select the Orders table (the \"many\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. When you click Next , assuming that you set up the relationships correctly before you starte', 'or query. When you click Next , assuming that you set up the relationships correctly before you started the wizard, the wizard asks How do you want to view your data? — that is, by which table or query. Select the table on the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship. For this example, to create the Employees form, we will click by Employees . The wizard displays a small diagram of a form. The page should resemble the following illustration: The box in the lower portion of the form diagram represents the subform. Note: If the wizard does not ask How do you want to view your data? , that means that Access did not detect a one-to-many relationship between the tables or queries that you selected. The wizard will continue, but Access will not add a subform to the form. You might want to click Cancel and examine your table relationships before you continue. At the bottom of the wizard page, select Form with subform(s) , and then click Next . On the What layout would you like for your subform? page, click the lay', 'orm(s) , and then click Next . On the What layout would you like for your subform? page, click the layout option that you want, and then click Next . Both layout styles arrange the subform data in rows and columns, but a tabular layout is more customizable. You can add color, graphics, and other formatting elements to a tabular subform, whereas a datasheet is more compact, like the datasheet view of a table. On the next page of the wizard, select a formatting style for the form, and then click Next . If you chose Tabular on the previous page, the formatting style you choose will also be applied to the subform. On the last page of the wizard, type the titles that you want for the forms. Access names the forms based on the titles that you type, and labels the subform based on the title that you type for the subform. Specify whether you want to open the form in Form view, so that you can view or enter information, or in Design view, so that you can modify its design, and then click Finish. Access creates two for', 'n, or in Design view, so that you can modify its design, and then click Finish. Access creates two forms\\xa0— one for the main form that contains the subform control, and one for the subform itself. Top of Page Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Use this procedure to add one or more subforms to an existing form. For each subform, you can choose to have Access create a new form or use an existing form as the subform. Right-click the existing form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the down-arrow to display the Controls gallery, and ensure that Use Control Wizards is selected. On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the Subform/Subreport button. Click on the form where you want to place the subform. Follow the directions in the wizard. When you click Finish , Access adds a subform control to your form. If you chose to have Access create a new form for the subform instead of using an existing fo', 'ur form. If you chose to have Access create a new form for the subform instead of using an existing form, Access creates the new form object and adds it to the Navigation Pane. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Use this procedure if you want to use an existing form as a main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the form that you want to use as the main form, and then click Layout View . Drag the form that you want to use as the subform from the Navigation Pane onto the main form. Access adds a subform control to the main form and binds the control to the form that you dragged from the Navigation Pane. Access also tries to link the subform to the main form, based on the relationships that have been defined in your database. Repeat this step to add any additional subforms to the main form. To verify that the linking was successful, on the Home tab, in the Views group, click View , click Form View , and then use the ma', \"as successful, on the Home tab, in the Views group, click View , click Form View , and then use the main form's record selector to advance through several records. If the subform filters itself correctly for each employee, then the procedure is complete. If the previous test does not work, Access was unable to determine how to link the subform to the main form, and the Link Child Fields and Link Master Fields properties of the subform control are blank. You must set these properties manually by doing the following: Right-click the main form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . Click the subform control one time to select it. If the Property Sheet task pane is not displayed, press F4 to display it. In the Property Sheet, click the Data tab. Click the Build button next to the Link Child Fields property box. The Subform Field Linker dialog box appears. In the Master Fields and Child Fields drop-down lists, select the fields that you want to link the forms with, and then click OK . If you are not \", 'own lists, select the fields that you want to link the forms with, and then click OK . If you are not sure which fields to use, click Suggest to have Access try to determine the linking fields. Tip: If you do not see the field that you want to use to link the forms, you might need to edit the record source of the master form or child form to help make sure that the linking field is in it. For example, if the form is based on a query, you should make sure that the linking field is present in the query results. Save the main form, switch to Form view, and then verify that the form works as expected. Open a subform in a new window in Design view If you want to make design changes to a subform while you are working on its main form in Design view, you can open the subform in its own window: Click the subform to select it. On the Form Design tab, in the Tools group, click Subform in New Window . Top of Page Change the default view of a subform When you add a subform to a form, the subform/subreport control display', ' the default view of a subform When you add a subform to a form, the subform/subreport control displays the subform according to the subform’s Default View property. This property can be set to the following values: Single Form Continuous Forms Datasheet Split Form When you first create a subform, this property may be set to Continuous Forms or perhaps Single Form . However, if you set the Default View property of a subform to Datasheet , then the subform will display as a datasheet on the main form. To set the Default View property of a subform: Close any open objects. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the subform and then click Design View . If the Property Sheet is not already displayed, press F4 to display it. In the drop-down list at the top of the Property Sheet, make sure Form is selected. On the Format tab of the Property Sheet, set the Default View property to the view you want to use. Note: If the view you want to use is not in the list, make sure the “Allow…View” property for the view is set to Y', ' view you want to use is not in the list, make sure the “Allow…View” property for the view is set to Yes . For example, if you want to specify Datasheet as the default view for the form, make sure that the Allow Datasheet View property is set to Yes . Save and close the subform, and then open the main form to check the results. Top of Page Add related data to a form without creating a subform It is not always necessary to create a separate form object to display related data. For example, if you are working on a form in Layout view or Design view and you drag a table or query from the Navigation Pane to the form, Access creates a subform/subreport control that displays the data in that object. The object’s Default View property determines how the data is displayed. Usually, this is set to Datasheet view, but you can also set the Default View property of a table or query to Single Form , Split Form , or Continuous Forms , giving you more flexibility in displaying related data on forms. Note: Changing the Defau', 'uous Forms , giving you more flexibility in displaying related data on forms. Note: Changing the Default View property for a table or query determines how it is displayed whenever it is opened, whether you open it from the Navigation Pane or view it in a subform/subreport control. Because changing the view settings for a table can sometimes cause confusion when opening the table from the Navigation Pane, we recommend using a query for this procedure instead of a table.

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn\\xa0different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see w', 'een two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three\\xa0related tables: Customers CustomerDiscounts Orders Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously\\xa0import multiple tables. You can also use ', 'automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously\\xa0import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each\\xa0contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID ', 'In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in th', 'ique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship.\\xa0The foreign key is referred to as the\\xa0source column or just column.\\xa0In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default\\xa0Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table.\\xa0However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is\\xa0one-to-one. I', 'ers, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is\\xa0one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has\\xa0a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel\\xa0must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have m', 'more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you ', 'wing requirements are met: Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A\\xa0composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To\\xa0create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in.', 'ou import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A\\xa0Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables\\xa0in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an\\xa0Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a\\xa0workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Table 2, column f Table 2, column f\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Table 3, column n Table 3, column n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection a', 'a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot\\xa0analyzes the data in the tables. It\\xa0detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. Fo', 'ypes are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the l', 'ake sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic De', ' automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for ', \"elationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

For example, look up the\\xa0price of an automotive part by the part number, or find an employee name based on their employee ID. With XLOOKUP, you can look in one column for a search term and return a result from the same row in another column, regardless of which side the return column is on. Note: XLOOKUP is not available in Excel 2016 and Excel 2019, however, you may come across a situation of using a workbook in Excel 2016 or Excel 2019 with the XLOOKUP function in it created by someone else using a newer version of Excel. Syntax The\\xa0XLOOKUP\\xa0function searches a range or an array, and then returns the item\\xa0cor', \"sion of Excel. Syntax The\\xa0XLOOKUP\\xa0function searches a range or an array, and then returns the item\\xa0corresponding\\xa0to the\\xa0first match it finds. If no match exists,\\xa0then XLOOKUP can return the\\xa0closest (approximate) match. =XLOOKUP(lookup_value,\\xa0lookup_array,\\xa0return_array,\\xa0[if_not_found], [match_mode],\\xa0[search_mode]) Examples Example 1 uses XLOOKUP to look up a country name in a range, and then return its telephone country code. It includes the lookup_value (cell F2), lookup_array (range B2:B11), and return_array (range D2:D11) arguments. It doesn't include the match_mode argument, as XLOOKUP produces an exact match by default. Note: XLOOKUP uses a lookup array\\xa0and a return array, whereas VLOOKUP uses a single table array followed by a column index number. The equivalent VLOOKUP formula in this case would be: =VLOOKUP(F2,B2:D11,3,FALSE) ——————————————————————————— Example 2 looks up employee information based on an employee ID number. Unlike VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP can return an array with multiple items, so\\xa0a single fo\", \"an employee ID number. Unlike VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP can return an array with multiple items, so\\xa0a single formula can return both employee name and department from cells C5:D14. ——————————————————————————— Example 3 adds an if_not_found argument to the preceding example. ——————————————————————————— Example 4 looks in column C for the personal income entered in cell E2, and finds a matching tax rate in column B. It sets the if_not_found argument to return 0 (zero) if nothing is found. The match_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will look for an exact match, and if it can't find one, it returns the next larger item. Finally, the search_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will search from the first item to the last. Note: XARRAY's lookup_array column is to the right of the return_array column, whereas VLOOKUP can only look from left-to-right. ——————————————————————————— Example 5 uses a nested XLOOKUP function to perform both a vertical and horizontal match. It first looks for Gross\", 'es a nested XLOOKUP function to perform both a vertical and horizontal match. It first looks for Gross Profit in column B, then looks for Qtr1 in the top row of the table (range C5:F5), and finally returns the value at the intersection of the two. This is similar to using the INDEX and MATCH functions together. Tip: You can also use XLOOKUP to replace the HLOOKUP function. Note: The formula in cells D3:F3 is: =XLOOKUP(D2,$B6:$B17,XLOOKUP($C3,$C5:$G5,$C6:$G17)) . ——————————————————————————— Example 6 uses the SUM function , and two nested XLOOKUP functions, to sum all the values between two ranges. In this case, we want to sum the values for grapes, bananas, and include pears, which are between the two. The formula in cell E3 is: =SUM(XLOOKUP(B3,B6:B10,E6:E10):XLOOKUP(C3,B6:B10,E6:E10)) How does it work? XLOOKUP returns a range, so when it calculates, the formula ends up looking like this: =SUM($E$7:$E$9) . You can see how this works on your own by selecting a cell with an XLOOKUP formula similar to this one, ', 'u can see how this works on your own by selecting a cell with an XLOOKUP formula similar to this one, then select Formulas > Formula Auditing > Evaluate Formula , and then select Evaluate to step through the calculation. Note: Thanks to Microsoft Excel MVP, Bill Jelen , for suggesting this example. ——————————————————————————— See also You can always ask an expert in the Excel Tech Community or get support in Communities .
