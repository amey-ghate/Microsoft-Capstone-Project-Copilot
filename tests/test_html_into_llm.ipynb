Access Tables Creating tables Creating tables Introduction to tables Introduction to tables Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less Tables are essential objects in a database because they hold all the information or data. For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables in Access, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need. For an introduction to planning and designing a database, see Database design basics . In this article Overview Table and field properties Data Types Table relationships Keys Benefits of using relationships Overview A relational database like Access usually has several related tables. In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com . Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. You must set a field's data type when you create the field. You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon. Examples of automatic data type detection The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view. If you enter: Access creates a field with a data type of: John Short Text http://www.contoso.com You can use any valid Internet protocol prefix.

For example, a database might contain: A customers table that lists your company’s customers and their addresses. A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item. An orders table that tracks customer orders. Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common. For more information, see Guide to table relationships . Top of Page Keys Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys: Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key . Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table. The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID. To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order's customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table. 1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name. 2. A foreign key — note the absence of the key icon. Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. Top of Page Benefits of using relationships Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits: Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer's name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data. Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don't use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance. Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables in Access, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need.

To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common.

A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys:</p>\\r\\n          <ul>\\r\\n    <li itemprop=\"itemListElement\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ListItem\">\\r\\n              <p>\\r\\n                <b class=\"ocpRunInHead\">Primary key</b>\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see <a href=\"/en-us/office/add-or-change-a-table-s-primary-key-in-access-07b4a84b-0063-4d56-8b00-65f2975e4379\" class=\"ocpArticleLink\" data-bi-area=\"BKMK_Keys\" data-bi-type=\"anchor\">adding or changing a table’s primary key</a>.</p>\\r\\n            <meta itemprop=\"position\" content=\"1\">\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li itemprop=\"itemListElement\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ListItem\">\\r\\n              <p>\\r\\n                <b class=\"ocpRunInHead\">Foreign key</b>\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table.</p>\\r\\n            <meta itemprop=\"position\" content=\"2\">\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n  </ul>\\r\\n          <p>The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID.</p>\\r\\n          <p>To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order\\'s customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table.</p>\\r\\n          <picture><img class=\"fluentImage\" src=\"https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/5eef1cb2-d68a-4275-a676-2f330b61e279.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"An Access table relationship shown in the Relationships window\"></picture>\\r\\n          <p>1.

A foreign key\\xa0— note the absence of the key icon.</p>\\r\\n          <p>Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables.</p>\\r\\n          <p>\\r\\n            <a href=\"#\" class=\"ocpTopOfPage\" data-bi-area=\"BKMK_Keys\" data-bi-type=\"anchor\">Top of Page</a>\\r\\n          </p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n      </section><section aria-labelledby=\"ID0EDF\" class=\"ocpSection\" id=\"bkmk_benefits\" data-bi-id=\"bkmk_benefits\">\\r\\n        <h2 id=\"ID0EDF\" class=\"\">Benefits of using relationships</h2>\\r\\n        \\r\\n          <p>Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits:</p>\\r\\n          <ul>\\r\\n    <li itemprop=\"itemListElement\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ListItem\">\\r\\n              <p>\\r\\n                <b class=\"ocpRunInHead\">Consistency</b>\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer\\'s name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data.</p>\\r\\n            <meta itemprop=\"position\" content=\"1\">\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li itemprop=\"itemListElement\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ListItem\">\\r\\n              <p>\\r\\n                <b class=\"ocpRunInHead\">Efficiency</b>\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don\\'t use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance.</p>\\r\\n            <meta itemprop=\"position\" content=\"2\">\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li itemprop=\"itemListElement\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ListItem\">\\r\\n              <p>\\r\\n                <b class=\"ocpRunInHead\">Comprehensibility</b>\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables.</p>\\r\\n            <meta itemprop=\"position\" content=\"3\">\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n  </ul>\\r\\n          <p>Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

Access Tables Creating tables Creating tables Introduction to tables Introduction to tables Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less Tables are essential objects in a database because they hold all the information or data. For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables in Access, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need. For an introduction to planning and designing a database, see Database design basics . In this article Overview Table and field properties Data Types Table relationships Keys Benefits of using relationships Overview A relational database like Access usually has several related tables. In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com . Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. You must set a field's data type when you create the field. You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon. Examples of automatic data type detection The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view. If you enter: Access creates a field with a data type of: John Short Text http://www.contoso.com You can use any valid Internet protocol prefix. For example, http://, https://, and mailto: are valid prefixes. Hyperlink 1 Number, Long Integer 50,000 Number, Long Integer 50,000.99 Number, Double 50000.389 Number, Double 12/67 The date and time formats recognized are those of your user locale. Date/Time December 31, 2016 Date/Time 10:50:23 Date/Time 10:50 am Date/Time 17:50 Date/Time $12.50 The currency symbol recognized is that of your user locale. Currency 21.75 Number, Double 123.00% Number, Double 3.46E+03 Number, Double Top of Page Table relationships Although each table stores data about a different subject, tables in an Access database usually store data about subjects that are related to each other. For example, a database might contain: A customers table that lists your company’s customers and their addresses. A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item. An orders table that tracks customer orders. Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common. For more information, see Guide to table relationships . Top of Page Keys Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys: Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key . Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table. The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID. To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order's customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table. 1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name. 2. A foreign key — note the absence of the key icon. Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. Top of Page Benefits of using relationships Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits: Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer's name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data. Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don't use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance. Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

Less After you create a table, Microsoft Office Word 2007 offers you many ways to format that table. If you decide to use Table Styles, you can format your table all at once, and even see a preview of what your table will look like formatted in a particular style before you actually apply the style. You can create a custom look for tables by splitting or merging cells, adding or deleting columns or rows, or adding borders. If you're working with a long table, you can repeat the table headings on each page on which the table appears. To prevent awkward page breaks that disrupt the flow of your table, you can also specify just how and where the table should break across pages. What do you want to do? Use Table Styles to format an entire table Add or remove borders Display or hide gridlines Add a cell, row, or column Delete a cell, row, or column Merge or split cells Repeat a table heading on subsequent pages Control where a table is divided Use Table Styles to format an entire table After you create a table, you can format the entire table by using Table Styles.

The power of a relational database lies in combining data across tables. To do that, you first need to establish relationships between your tables. Then, put Access to work to combine data in queries, forms, and reports. To see all existing relationships defined for a database, open an Access template, go to the Database Tools tab, and select Relationships . Note: If you open a blank database or haven’t defined any table relationships, Access prompts you to add a table or query. Before you can add a relationship, you need at least two tables. Ideally, you build all of your tables first. To learn more, see Create relationships with the Lookup Wizard and Create relationships with the Relationships Pane . Understanding the Relationships view The lines in the Relationships view indicate connections between the tables. In the following image, the table on the left is the parent table. The table on the right is the child table. The line between them connects the fields (in this case, Order ID and Product ID) used to match data. Lines and symbols show you how your tables are related: A thick connecting line means you’re enforcing referential data integrity. That’s good. It keeps your data synced. In our illustration, the number 1 indicates that there can be only one matching record in that table. In the Orders table shown here, only one record matches each order. The ∞ symbol indicates that many records can include the same ID. In the Order Details table shown here, an order (indicated by its order ID) may appear more than once, because the same order may include multiple products. Types of relationships between tables There are three types of relationships between tables: One-to-one . When each item in each table only appears once. For example, each employee can have only one company car to use. For more information, see Create one-to-one relationships . One-to-many . When one item in one table can have a relationship to multiple items in another table. For example, each purchase order can include multiple products. Many-to-many . When one or more items in one table can have a relationship to one or more items in another table. For example, each order can have multiple products, and each product can appear on many orders. To find out more, see Create many-to-many relationships . One-to-many relationships One of the most common relationships between tables in well-designed databases is the one-to-many relationship. Relationships between tables normally rely on the primary key in one of the tables. Recall that the primary key is a unique identifier (often numeric) for each record. To show that the information in two different tables is related, you usually create a relationship using the primary key from one of the tables. In the relationship shown here, for example, each person in the Contacts table has an ID, which is the primary key (indicated by the key symbol next to it). That ID also appears in the Owner field in the Assets table. To email the person associated with an asset, get the value from the Email Address field. To do so, look for the value in the Owner field of the Asset table and then search for that ID in the Contacts table. The number 1 at one end of the connecting line and the ∞ symbol at the other end indicate that this is a one-to-many relationship, so one contact might be associated with many assets. Edit a relationship If you are modifying an existing database or if you created your database from a template, you can edit the existing relationships to meet your needs. Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . On the Design tab, select Edit Relationships . Table/Query is the parent table on the left (in this example, Customers). Related Table/Query is the child table (in this example, Orders). Even if the tables don’t appear in this order in the Relationships view, their placement in the dialog box indicates the direction of the line connecting them and the relationship. That’s important if, for example, it’s a one-to-many relationship, because it indicates that the table on the left is the one (the parent table) and the table on the right is the many (the child table). To change the fields that connect the tables, select a different field below each table shown. In this example, the ID field in the Customers table connects to the Customer ID field in the Orders table. Change the way Access synchronizes your data between tables. Enforce Referential Integrity To prevent invalid data and to keep references in sync across table relationships, select this. For example, suppose you have a one-to-one relationship between the Employees and Employee Benefits tables. If an employee leaves the company and you remove them from your Employees table, the related employee record in the Employee Benefits table is removed, too. Sometimes enforcing referential integrity doesn’t make sense. For example, suppose you have a one-to-many relationship between Shippers and Orders. You delete a shipper, and that shipper maps to orders in the Orders table. Those orders become orphans, meaning that they still contain a Shipper ID, but the ID is no longer valid because the record that it references no longer exists. Cascade Update Related Fields To make sure that data in related fields is updated in all the related tables, select this. For example, suppose you simply want to change the ID of a shipper. Setting this option ensures that the Shipper ID is updated—not just in the Shipper table but also in any other tables connected to it that also include that Shipper ID, such as the Orders table. Cascade Delete Related Records The decision to select this depends on whether you need to retain records in some tables even though they might be deleted from other tables. For example, suppose you delete a shipper. If this option is selected, Access deletes all records in all tables that reference that Shipper ID, including all orders (in the Orders table) shipped by that shipper. You only select this option if you are sure you want your order history deleted. To change the relationship between the tables from an inner join to an outer join, select the Join Type button. For more information, see Create queries with outer joins . Delete a table relationship Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. To remove a table relationship: Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting the two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . Select the Delete key. If you’re prompted to verify that you want to delete the relationship, select Yes . Note: When you remove a relationship, you also remove referential integrity support for that relationship, if any. As a result, Access will no longer prevent changes that result in orphan records on the many side of a one-to-many relationship. Want more? Create, edit or delete a relationship Need more help?

Using structured references with Excel tables Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel 2021 Excel 2021 for Mac Excel 2019 Excel 2019 for Mac Excel 2016 Excel 2013 Excel Mobile More... Less When you create an Excel table , Excel assigns a name to the table, and to each column header in the table. When you add formulas to an Excel table, those names can appear automatically as you enter the formula and select the cell references in the table instead of manually entering them. Here\\'s an example of what Excel does: Instead of using explicit cell references Excel uses table and column names =Sum(C2:C7) =SUM(DeptSales[Sales Amount]) That combination of table and column names is called a structured reference. The names in structured references adjust whenever you add or remove data from the table. Structured references also appear when you create a formula outside of an Excel table that references table data. The references can make it easier to locate tables in a large workbook. To include structured references in your formula, click the table cells you want to reference instead of typing their cell reference in the formula. Let’s use the following example data to enter a formula that automatically uses structured references to calculate the amount of a sales commission. Sales Person Region Sales Amount % Commission Commission Amount Joe North 260 10% Robert South 660 15% Michelle East 940 15% Erich West 410 12% Dafna North 800 15% Rob South 900 15% Copy the sample data in the table above, including the column headings, and paste it into cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet. To create the table, select any cell within the data range, and press Ctrl+T . Make sure the My table has headers box is checked, and click OK . In cell E2, type an equal sign ( = ), and click cell C2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[Sales Amount]] appears after the equal sign. Type an asterisk ( * ) directly after the closing bracket, and click cell D2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[% Commission]] appears after the asterisk. Press Enter . Excel automatically creates a calculated column and copies the formula down the entire column for you, adjusting it for each row. What happens when I use explicit cell references? If you enter explicit cell references in a calculated column, it can be harder to see what the formula is calculating. In your sample worksheet, click cell E2 In the formula bar, enter =C2*D2 and press Enter . Notice that while Excel copies your formula down the column, it doesn\\'t use structured references. If, for example, you add a column between the existing columns C and D, you\\'d have to revise your formula. How do I change a table name? When you create an Excel table, Excel creates a default table name (Table1, Table2, and so on), but you can change the table name to make it more meaningful. Select any cell in the table to show the Table Tools > Design tab on the ribbon. Type the name you want in the Table Name box, and press Enter . In our example data, we used the name DeptSales . Use the following rules for table names: Use valid characters Always start a name with a letter, an underscore character ( _ ), or a backslash ( \\\\ ). Use letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters for the rest of the name. You can’t use \"C\", \"c\", \"R\", or \"r\" for the name, because they’re already designated as a shortcut for selecting the column or row for the active cell when you enter them in the Name or Go To box. Don’t use cell references Names can’t be the same as a cell reference, such as Z$100 or R1C1. Don’t use a space to separate words Spaces can’t be used in the name. You can use the underscore character ( _ ) and period ( . ) as word separators. For example, DeptSales, Sales_Tax or First.Quarter. Use no more than 255 characters A table name can have up to 255 characters. Use unique table names Duplicate names aren’t allowed. Excel doesn’t distinguish between upper and lowercase characters in names so if you enter “Sales” but already have another name called “SALES\" in the same workbook, you’ll be prompted to choose a unique name. Use an object identifier If you plan on having a mix of tables, PivotTables and charts, it\\'s a good idea to prefix your names with the object type. For example: tbl_Sales for a sales table, pt_Sales for a sales PivotTable, and chrt_Sales for a sales chart, or ptchrt_Sales for a sales PivotChart. This keeps all of your names in an ordered list in the Name Manager . Structured reference syntax rules You can also enter or change structured references manually in the formula but to do that, it will help to understand structured reference syntax. Let’s go over the following formula example: =SUM(DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]],DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]]) This formula has the following structured reference components: Table name: DeptSales is a custom table name. It references the table data, without any header or total rows. You can use a default table name, such as Table1, or change it to use a custom name. Column specifier: [Sales Amount] and [Commission Amount ] are column specifiers that use the names of the columns they represent. They reference the column data, without any column header or total row. Always enclose specifiers in brackets as shown. Item specifier: [#Totals] and [#Data] are special item specifiers that refer to specific portions of the table, such as the total row. Table specifier: [[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and [[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are table specifiers that represent the outer portions of the structured reference. Outer references follow the table name, and you enclose them in square brackets. Structured reference: (DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are structured references, represented by a string that begins with the table name and ends with the column specifier. To create or edit structured references manually, use these syntax rules: Use brackets around specifiers All table, column, and special item specifiers need to be enclosed in matching brackets ([ ]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer matching brackets to enclose the inner matching brackets of the other specifiers. For example: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All column headers are text strings But they don’t require quotes when they’re used in a structured reference. Numbers or dates, such as 2014 or 1/1/2014, are also considered text strings. You can’t use expressions with column headers. For example, the expression DeptSalesFYSummary[[2014]:[2012]] won’t work. Use brackets around column headers with special characters If there are special characters, the entire column header needs to be enclosed in brackets, which means that double brackets are required in a column specifier. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[[Total $ Amount]] Here’s the list of special characters that need extra brackets in the formula: Tab Line feed Carriage return Comma (,) Colon (:) Period (.) Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign (#) Single quotation mark (\\') Double quotation mark (\") Left brace ({) Right brace (}) Dollar sign ($) Caret (^) Ampersand (&) Asterisk (*) Plus sign (+) Equal sign (=) Minus sign (-) Greater than symbol (>) Less than symbol (<) Division sign (/) At sign (@) Backslash (\\\\) Exclamation point (!) Left parenthesis (() Right parenthesis ()) Percent sign (%) Question mark (?) Backtick (`) Semicolon (;) Tilde (~) Underscore (_) Use an escape character for some special characters in column headers Some characters have special meaning and require the use of a single quotation mark (\\') as an escape character. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[\\'#OfItems] Here’s the list of special characters that need an escape character (\\') in the formula: Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign(#) Single quotation mark (\\') At sign (@) Use the space character to improve readability in a structured reference You can use space characters to improve the readability of a structured reference. For example: =DeptSales[ [Sales Person]:[Region] ] or =DeptSales[[#Headers], [#Data], [% Commission]] It’s recommended to use one space: After the first left bracket ([) Preceding the last right bracket (]). After a comma. Reference operators For more flexibility in specifying ranges of cells, you can use the following reference operators to combine column specifiers. This structured reference: Refers to: By using the: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All of the cells in two or more adjacent columns : (colon) range operator A2:B7 =DeptSales[Sales Amount],DeptSales[Commission Amount] A combination of two or more columns , (comma) union operator C2:C7, E2:E7 =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Sales Amount]] DeptSales[[Region]:[% Commission]] The intersection of two or more columns (space) intersection operator B2:C7 Special item specifiers To refer to specific portions of a table, such as just the totals row, you can use any of the following special item specifiers in your structured references. This special item specifier: Refers to: #All The entire table, including column headers, data, and totals (if any). #Data Just the data rows. #Headers Just the header row. #Totals Just the total row. If none exists, then it returns null. #This Row or @ or @[Column Name] Just the cells in the same row as the formula. These specifiers can’t be combined with any other special item specifiers. Use them to force implicit intersection behavior for the reference or to override implicit intersection behavior and refer to single values from a column. Excel automatically changes #This Row specifiers to the shorter @ specifier in tables that have more than one row of data. But if your table has only one row, Excel doesn’t replace the #This Row specifier, which may cause unexpected calculation results when you add more rows. To avoid calculation problems, make sure you enter multiple rows in your table before you enter any structured reference formulas. Qualifying structured references in calculated columns When you create a calculated column, you often use a structured reference to create the formula. This structured reference can be unqualified or fully qualified. For example, to create the calculated column, called Commission Amount, that calculates the amount of commission in dollars, you can use the following formulas: Type of structured reference Example Comment Unqualified =[Sales Amount]*[% Commission] Multiplies the corresponding values from the current row. Fully qualified =DeptSales[Sales Amount]*DeptSales[% Commission] Multiples the corresponding values for each row for both columns. The general rule to follow is this: If you’re using structured references within a table, such as when you create a calculated column, you can use an unqualified structured reference, but if you use the structured reference outside of the table, you need to use a fully qualified structured reference. Examples of using structured references Here are some ways to use structured references. This structured reference: Refers to: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]] All the cells in the Sales Amount column. C1:C8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[% Commission]] The header of the % Commission column. D1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Region]] The total of the Region column. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. B8 =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]:[% Commission]] All the cells in Sales Amount and % Commission. C1:D8 =DeptSales[[#Data],[% Commission]:[Commission Amount]] Just the data of the % Commission and Commission Amount columns. D2:E7 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[Region]:[Commission Amount]] Just the headers of the columns between Region and Commission Amount. B1:E1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]:[Commission Amount]] The totals of the Sales Amount through Commission Amount columns. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. C8:E8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[#Data],[% Commission]] Just the header and the data of % Commission. D1:D7 =DeptSales[[#This Row], [Commission Amount]] or =DeptSales[@Commission Amount] The cell at the intersection of the current row and the Commission Amount column. If used in the same row as a header or total row, this will return a #VALUE! error. If you type the longer form of this structured reference (#This Row) in a table with multiple rows of data, Excel automatically replaces it with the shorter form (@). They both work the same. E5 (if the current row is 5) Strategies for working with structured references Consider the following when you work with structured references. Use Formula AutoComplete You may find that using Formula AutoComplete is very useful when you enter structured references and to ensure the use of correct syntax. For more information, see Use Formula AutoComplete . Decide whether to generate structured references for tables in semi-selections By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi-selects the cells and automatically enters a structured reference instead of the cell range in the formula. This semi-selection behavior makes it much easier to enter a structured reference. You can turn this behavior on or off by selecting or clearing the Use table names in formulas check box in the File > Options > Formulas > Working with formulas dialog. Use workbooks with external links to Excel tables in other workbooks If a workbook contains an external link to an Excel table in another workbook, that linked source workbook must be open in Excel to avoid #REF! errors in the destination workbook that contains the links. If you open the destination workbook first and #REF! errors appear, they will be resolved if you then open the source workbook. If you open the source workbook first, you should see no error codes. Convert a range to a table and a table to a range When you convert a table to a range, all cell references change to their equivalent absolute A1 style references. When you convert a range to a table, Excel doesn’t automatically change any cell references of this range to their equivalent structured references. Turn off column headers You can toggle table column headers on and off from the table Design tab > Header Row . If you turn off table column headers, structured references that use column names aren’t affected, and you can still use them in formulas. Structured references that refer directly to the table headers (e.g. =DeptSales[[#Headers],[%Commission]] ) will result in #REF . Add or delete columns and rows to the table Because table data ranges often change, cell references for structured references adjust automatically. For example, if you use a table name in a formula to count all the data cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts. Rename a table or column If you rename a column or table, Excel automatically changes the use of that table and column header in all structured references that are used in the workbook. Move, copy, and fill structured references All structured references remain the same when you copy or move a formula that uses a structured reference. Note: Copying a structured reference and doing a fill of a structured reference are not the same thing. When you copy, all the structured references remain the same, while when you fill a formula, fully qualified structured references adjust the column specifiers like a series as summarized in the following table. If the fill direction is: And while filling, you press: Then: Up or down Nothing There is no column specifier adjustment. Up or down Ctrl Column specifiers adjust like a series. Right or left None Column specifiers adjust like a series. Up, down, right, or left Shift Instead of overwriting values in current cells, current cell values are moved and column specifiers are inserted. Need more help?

Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less You can merge (combine) rows from one table into another simply by pasting the data in the first empty cells below the target table. The table will increase in size to include the new rows. If the rows in both tables match up, you can merge the columns of one table with another—by pasting them in the first empty cells to the right of the table. In this case also, the table will increase to accommodate the new columns. Merging rows is actually quite simple, but merging columns can be tricky if the rows of one table don\\'t correspond with the rows in the other table. By using VLOOKUP , you can avoid some of the alignment problems. Merge two tables using the VLOOKUP function In the example shown below, you\\'ll see two tables that previously had other names to new names: \"Blue\" and \"Orange.\" In the Blue table, each row is a line item for an order. So, Order ID 20050 has two items, Order ID 20051 has one item, Order ID 20052 has three items, and so on. We want to merge the Sales ID and Region columns with the Blue table, based on matching values in the Order ID columns of the Orange table. Order ID values repeat in the Blue table, but Order ID values in the Orange table are unique. If we were to simply copy-and-paste the data from the Orange table, the Sales ID and Region values for the second line item of order 20050 would be off by one row, which would change the values in the new columns in the Blue table. Here\\'s the data for the Blue table, which you can copy into a blank worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the Excel table Blue. Order ID Sale Date Product ID 20050 2/2/14 C6077B 20050 2/2/14 C9250LB 20051 2/2/14 M115A 20052 2/3/14 A760G 20052 2/3/14 E3331 20052 2/3/14 SP1447 20053 2/3/14 L88M 20054 2/4/14 S1018MM 20055 2/5/14 C6077B 20056 2/6/14 E3331 20056 2/6/14 D534X Here\\'s the data for the Orange table. Copy it into the same worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the table Orange. Order ID Sales ID Region 20050 447 West 20051 398 South 20052 1006 North 20053 447 West 20054 885 East 20055 398 South 20056 644 East 20057 1270 East 20058 885 East We need to ensure that the Sales ID and Region values for each order align correctly with each unique order line item. To do this, let\\'s paste the table headings Sales ID and Region into the cells to the right of the Blue table, and use VLOOKUP formulas to get the correct values from the Sales ID and Region columns of the Orange table. Here\\'s how: Copy the headings Sales ID and Region in the Orange table (only those two cells). Paste the headings into the cell, to the right of the Product ID heading of the Blue table. Now, the Blue table is five columns wide, including the new Sales ID and Region columns. In the Blue table, in the first cell beneath Sales ID, start writing this formula: =VLOOKUP( In the Blue table, pick the first cell in the Order ID column, 20050. The partially completed formula looks like this: The [@[Order ID]] part means \"get the value in this same row from the Order ID column.\" Type a comma, and select the entire Orange table with your mouse so that \"Orange[#All]\" is added to the formula. Type another comma, 2, another comma, and 0—like this: ,2,0 Press Enter, and the completed formula looks like this: The Orange[#All] part means \"look in all the cells in the Orange table.\" The 2 means \"get the value from the second column,\" and the 0 means \"return the value only if there\\'s an exact match.\" Notice that Excel filled the cells down in that column, using the VLOOKUP formula. Return to step 3, but this time start writing the same formula in the first cell beneath Region. In step 6, replace 2 with 3, so the completed formula looks like this: There\\'s just one difference between this formula and the first formula—the first gets values from column 2 of the Orange table, and the second gets them from column 3. Now you\\'ll see values in every cell of the new columns in the Blue table. They contain VLOOKUP formulas, but they\\'ll show the values. You\\'ll want to convert the VLOOKUP formulas in those cells to their actual values. Select all the value cells in the Sales ID column, and press Ctrl+C to copy them. Click Home > arrow below Paste . In the Paste gallery, click Paste Values . Select all the value cells in the Region column, copy them, and repeat steps 10 and 11. Now the VLOOKUP formulas in the two columns have been replaced with the values.

Less When you are working with relational data (related data that is stored in separate tables) in Access, you often need to view multiple tables or queries on the same form. For example, you might want to see customer data from one table and information about customer orders from another table at the same time. Subforms are a convenient tool for doing this, and Access provides several ways to help you create subforms quickly. What do you want to do? Learn about subforms Create or add a subform Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Open a subform in a new window in Design view Change the default view of a subform Add related data to a form without creating a subform Learn about subforms A subform is a form that is inserted in another form. The primary form is called the main form, and the form that is enclosed in form is called the subform. A form/subform combination is sometimes referred to as a hierarchical form, a master/detail form, or a parent/child form. Subforms are especially effective when you want to show data from tables or queries that have a one-to-many relationship. A one-to-many relationship is an association between two tables in which the primary key value of each record in the primary table corresponds to the value in the matching field or fields of many records in the related table. For example, you can create a form that displays employee data, and contains a subform that displays each employee\\'s orders. The data in the Employees table is the \"one\" side of the relationship. The data in the Orders table is the \"many\" side of the relationship — each employee can have more than one order. 1. The main form shows data from the \"one\" side of the relationship. 2. The subform shows data from the \"many\" side of the relationship. The main form and subform in this kind of form are linked so that the subform displays only records that are related to the current record in the main form. For example, when the main form displays Nancy Freehafer\\'s information, the subform displays only her orders. If the form and subform were unlinked, the subform would display all the orders, not just Nancy\\'s. The following table defines some of the terminology that is associated with subforms. Access will handle most of the details if you use the procedures in this article, but it is helpful to know what is occurring behind the scenes if you need to make modifications later. Term Definition Subform control The control that embeds a form into a form. You can think of the subform control as a \"view\" of another object in your database, whether it is another form, a table, or a query. The subform control provides properties which allow you to link the data displayed in the control to the data on the main form. Source Object property The property of the subform control that determines what object is displayed in the control. Datasheet A simple display of data in rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. The subform control displays a datasheet when its source object is a table or query, or when its source object is a form whose Default View property is set to Datasheet. In these cases, the subform is sometimes referred to as a datasheet or subdatasheet instead of as a subform. Link Child Fields property The property of the subform control that specifies which field or fields in the subform link the subform to the main form. Link Master Fields property The property of the subform control that specifies which field or fields on the main form link the main form to the subform. Notes: For best results, establish table relationships before following the procedures in this article. This enables Access to automatically create the links between subforms and main forms. To view, add, or modify relationships between the tables in your database, on the Database Tools tab, in the Relationships group, click Relationships . When a subform control has a form as its source object, it contains the fields that you place on the form, and it can be viewed as a single form, continuous form, or datasheet. One advantage of basing a subform on a form object is that you can add calculated fields to the subform, such as [Quantity] * [Unit price] . You can insert a datasheet or pivot view into a form by creating a subform control whose source object is a table or query. For more information, see the section Add related data to a form without creating a subform . Top of Page Create or add a subform Use the following table to determine which procedure is most appropriate for your situation. Scenario Recommended procedure You want Access to create both a main form and a subform, and to link the subform to the main form. Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard You want to use an existing form as the main form, but you want Access to create a new subform and add it to the main form. Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the Subform Wizard You want to use an existing form as the main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard This procedure creates a new form and subform combination by using the Form Wizard. This is also the quickest way to get started if you have not already created the forms that you want to use as the main form or the subform. On the Create tab, in the Forms group, click Form Wizard . On the first page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select a table or query. For this example, to create an Employees form that displays orders for each employee in a subform, we will select Table: Employees (the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Note: It does not matter which table or query you choose first. Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. On the same page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select another table or query from the list. For this example, we will select the Orders table (the \"many\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. When you click Next , assuming that you set up the relationships correctly before you started the wizard, the wizard asks How do you want to view your data? — that is, by which table or query. Select the table on the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship. For this example, to create the Employees form, we will click by Employees . The wizard displays a small diagram of a form. The page should resemble the following illustration: The box in the lower portion of the form diagram represents the subform. Note: If the wizard does not ask How do you want to view your data? , that means that Access did not detect a one-to-many relationship between the tables or queries that you selected. The wizard will continue, but Access will not add a subform to the form. You might want to click Cancel and examine your table relationships before you continue. At the bottom of the wizard page, select Form with subform(s) , and then click Next . On the What layout would you like for your subform? page, click the layout option that you want, and then click Next . Both layout styles arrange the subform data in rows and columns, but a tabular layout is more customizable. You can add color, graphics, and other formatting elements to a tabular subform, whereas a datasheet is more compact, like the datasheet view of a table. On the next page of the wizard, select a formatting style for the form, and then click Next . If you chose Tabular on the previous page, the formatting style you choose will also be applied to the subform. On the last page of the wizard, type the titles that you want for the forms. Access names the forms based on the titles that you type, and labels the subform based on the title that you type for the subform. Specify whether you want to open the form in Form view, so that you can view or enter information, or in Design view, so that you can modify its design, and then click Finish. Access creates two forms — one for the main form that contains the subform control, and one for the subform itself. Top of Page Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Use this procedure to add one or more subforms to an existing form. For each subform, you can choose to have Access create a new form or use an existing form as the subform. Right-click the existing form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the down-arrow to display the Controls gallery, and ensure that Use Control Wizards is selected. On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the Subform/Subreport button. Click on the form where you want to place the subform. Follow the directions in the wizard. When you click Finish , Access adds a subform control to your form. If you chose to have Access create a new form for the subform instead of using an existing form, Access creates the new form object and adds it to the Navigation Pane. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Use this procedure if you want to use an existing form as a main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the form that you want to use as the main form, and then click Layout View . Drag the form that you want to use as the subform from the Navigation Pane onto the main form. Access adds a subform control to the main form and binds the control to the form that you dragged from the Navigation Pane. Access also tries to link the subform to the main form, based on the relationships that have been defined in your database. Repeat this step to add any additional subforms to the main form. To verify that the linking was successful, on the Home tab, in the Views group, click View , click Form View , and then use the main form\\'s record selector to advance through several records. If the subform filters itself correctly for each employee, then the procedure is complete. If the previous test does not work, Access was unable to determine how to link the subform to the main form, and the Link Child Fields and Link Master Fields properties of the subform control are blank. You must set these properties manually by doing the following: Right-click the main form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . Click the subform control one time to select it. If the Property Sheet task pane is not displayed, press F4 to display it. In the Property Sheet, click the Data tab. Click the Build button next to the Link Child Fields property box. The Subform Field Linker dialog box appears. In the Master Fields and Child Fields drop-down lists, select the fields that you want to link the forms with, and then click OK . If you are not sure which fields to use, click Suggest to have Access try to determine the linking fields. Tip: If you do not see the field that you want to use to link the forms, you might need to edit the record source of the master form or child form to help make sure that the linking field is in it. For example, if the form is based on a query, you should make sure that the linking field is present in the query results. Save the main form, switch to Form view, and then verify that the form works as expected. Open a subform in a new window in Design view If you want to make design changes to a subform while you are working on its main form in Design view, you can open the subform in its own window: Click the subform to select it. On the Form Design tab, in the Tools group, click Subform in New Window . Top of Page Change the default view of a subform When you add a subform to a form, the subform/subreport control displays the subform according to the subform’s Default View property. This property can be set to the following values: Single Form Continuous Forms Datasheet Split Form When you first create a subform, this property may be set to Continuous Forms or perhaps Single Form . However, if you set the Default View property of a subform to Datasheet , then the subform will display as a datasheet on the main form. To set the Default View property of a subform: Close any open objects. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the subform and then click Design View . If the Property Sheet is not already displayed, press F4 to display it. In the drop-down list at the top of the Property Sheet, make sure Form is selected. On the Format tab of the Property Sheet, set the Default View property to the view you want to use. Note: If the view you want to use is not in the list, make sure the “Allow…View” property for the view is set to Yes . For example, if you want to specify Datasheet as the default view for the form, make sure that the Allow Datasheet View property is set to Yes . Save and close the subform, and then open the main form to check the results. Top of Page Add related data to a form without creating a subform It is not always necessary to create a separate form object to display related data. For example, if you are working on a form in Layout view or Design view and you drag a table or query from the Navigation Pane to the form, Access creates a subform/subreport control that displays the data in that object. The object’s Default View property determines how the data is displayed. Usually, this is set to Datasheet view, but you can also set the Default View property of a table or query to Single Form , Split Form , or Continuous Forms , giving you more flexibility in displaying related data on forms. Note: Changing the Default View property for a table or query determines how it is displayed whenever it is opened, whether you open it from the Navigation Pane or view it in a subform/subreport control. Because changing the view settings for a table can sometimes cause confusion when opening the table from the Navigation Pane, we recommend using a query for this procedure instead of a table.

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Related topics Formulas & functions XLOOKUP Excel Help & Training Formulas & functions Formulas & functions XLOOKUP Overview of formulas in Excel Article XLOOKUP Article VLOOKUP Article SUM function Article COUNTIF function Article IF function Article IFS Article SUMIF Article SUMIFS Article MATCH Article Next: Common uses of functions XLOOKUP function Use the XLOOKUP function to find things in a table or range by row. For example, look up the price of an automotive part by the part number, or find an employee name based on their employee ID. With XLOOKUP, you can look in one column for a search term and return a result from the same row in another column, regardless of which side the return column is on. Note: XLOOKUP is not available in Excel 2016 and Excel 2019, however, you may come across a situation of using a workbook in Excel 2016 or Excel 2019 with the XLOOKUP function in it created by someone else using a newer version of Excel. Syntax The XLOOKUP function searches a range or an array, and then returns the item corresponding to the first match it finds. If no match exists, then XLOOKUP can return the closest (approximate) match. =XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]) Argument Description lookup_value Required* The value to search for *If omitted, XLOOKUP returns blank cells it finds in lookup_array . lookup_array Required The array or range to search return_array Required The array or range to return [if_not_found] Optional Where a valid match is not found, return the [if_not_found] text you supply. If a valid match is not found, and [if_not_found] is missing, #N/A is returned. [match_mode] Optional Specify the match type: 0 - Exact match. If none found, return #N/A. This is the default. -1 - Exact match. If none found, return the next smaller item. 1 - Exact match. If none found, return the next larger item. 2 - A wildcard match where *, ?, and ~ have special meaning . [search_mode] Optional Specify the search mode to use: 1 - Perform a search starting at the first item. This is the default. -1 - Perform a reverse search starting at the last item. 2 - Perform a binary search that relies on lookup_array being sorted in ascending order. If not sorted, invalid results will be returned. -2 - Perform a binary search that relies on lookup_array being sorted in descending order. If not sorted, invalid results will be returned. Examples Example 1 uses XLOOKUP to look up a country name in a range, and then return its telephone country code. It includes the lookup_value (cell F2), lookup_array (range B2:B11), and return_array (range D2:D11) arguments. It doesn't include the match_mode argument, as XLOOKUP produces an exact match by default. Note: XLOOKUP uses a lookup array and a return array, whereas VLOOKUP uses a single table array followed by a column index number. The equivalent VLOOKUP formula in this case would be: =VLOOKUP(F2,B2:D11,3,FALSE) ——————————————————————————— Example 2 looks up employee information based on an employee ID number. Unlike VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP can return an array with multiple items, so a single formula can return both employee name and department from cells C5:D14. ——————————————————————————— Example 3 adds an if_not_found argument to the preceding example. ——————————————————————————— Example 4 looks in column C for the personal income entered in cell E2, and finds a matching tax rate in column B. It sets the if_not_found argument to return 0 (zero) if nothing is found. The match_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will look for an exact match, and if it can't find one, it returns the next larger item. Finally, the search_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will search from the first item to the last. Note: XARRAY's lookup_array column is to the right of the return_array column, whereas VLOOKUP can only look from left-to-right. ——————————————————————————— Example 5 uses a nested XLOOKUP function to perform both a vertical and horizontal match. It first looks for Gross Profit in column B, then looks for Qtr1 in the top row of the table (range C5:F5), and finally returns the value at the intersection of the two. This is similar to using the INDEX and MATCH functions together. Tip: You can also use XLOOKUP to replace the HLOOKUP function. Note: The formula in cells D3:F3 is: =XLOOKUP(D2,$B6:$B17,XLOOKUP($C3,$C5:$G5,$C6:$G17)) . ——————————————————————————— Example 6 uses the SUM function , and two nested XLOOKUP functions, to sum all the values between two ranges. In this case, we want to sum the values for grapes, bananas, and include pears, which are between the two. The formula in cell E3 is: =SUM(XLOOKUP(B3,B6:B10,E6:E10):XLOOKUP(C3,B6:B10,E6:E10)) How does it work? XLOOKUP returns a range, so when it calculates, the formula ends up looking like this: =SUM($E$7:$E$9) . You can see how this works on your own by selecting a cell with an XLOOKUP formula similar to this one, then select Formulas > Formula Auditing > Evaluate Formula , and then select Evaluate to step through the calculation.

For example, you can do What-If Analysis to build two budgets that each assumes a certain level of revenue. Or, you can specify a result that you want a formula to produce, and then determine what sets of values will produce that result. Excel provides several different tools to help you perform the type of analysis that fits your needs. Note that this is just an overview of those tools. There are links to help topics for each one specifically. Overview What-If Analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. Three kinds of What-If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios , Goal Seek , and Data Tables . Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine possible results. A Data Table works with only one or two variables, but it can accept many different values for those variables. A Scenario can have multiple variables, but it can only accommodate up to 32 values. Goal Seek works differently from Scenarios and Data Tables in that it takes a result and determines possible input values that produce that result. In addition to these three tools, you can install add-ins that help you perform What-If Analysis, such as the Solver add-in. The Solver add-in is similar to Goal Seek, but it can accommodate more variables. You can also create forecasts by using the fill handle and various commands that are built into Excel. For more advanced models, you can use the Analysis ToolPak add-in . Use scenarios to consider many different variables A Scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on a worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values on a worksheet and then switch to any of these new scenarios to view different results. For example, suppose you have two budget scenarios: a worst case and a best case. You can use the Scenario Manager to create both scenarios on the same worksheet, and then switch between them. For each scenario, you specify the cells that change and the values to use for that scenario. When you switch between scenarios, the result cell changes to reflect the different changing cell values. 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell If several people have specific information in separate workbooks that you want to use in scenarios, you can collect those workbooks and merge their scenarios. After you have created or gathered all the scenarios that you need, you can create a Scenario Summary Report that incorporates information from those scenarios. A scenario report displays all the scenario information in one table on a new worksheet. Note: Scenario reports are not automatically recalculated. If you change the values of a scenario, those changes will not show up in an existing summary report. Instead, you must create a new summary report. Use Goal Seek to find out how to get a desired result If you know the result that you want from a formula, but you're not sure what input value the formula requires to get that result, you can use the Goal Seek feature. For example, suppose that you need to borrow some money. You know how much money you want, how long a period you want in which to pay off the loan, and how much you can afford to pay each month. You can use Goal Seek to determine what interest rate you must secure in order to meet your loan goal. Cells B1, B2, and B3 are the values for the loan amount, term length, and interest rate. Cell B4 displays the result of the formula =PMT(B3/12,B2,B1) . Note: Goal Seek works with only one variable input value. If you want to determine more than one input value, for example, the loan amount and the monthly payment amount for a loan, you should instead use the Solver add-in. For more information about the Solver add-in, see the section Prepare forecasts and advanced business models , and follow the links in the See Also section. Use Data Tables to see the effects of one or two variables on a formula If you have a formula that uses one or two variables, or multiple formulas that all use one common variable, you can use a Data Table to see all the outcomes in one place. Using Data Tables makes it easy to examine a range of possibilities at a glance. Because you focus on only one or two variables, results are easy to read and share in tabular form. If automatic recalculation is enabled for the workbook, the data in Data Tables immediately recalculates; as a result, you always have fresh data. Cell B3 contains the input value. Cells C3, C4, and C5 are values Excel substitutes based on the value entered in B3. A Data Table cannot accommodate more than two variables. If you want to analyze more than two variables, you can use Scenarios. Although it is limited to only one or two variables, a Data Table can use as many different variable values as you want. A Scenario can have a maximum of 32 different values, but you can create as many scenarios as you want. Prepare forecasts and advanced business models If you want to prepare forecasts, you can use Excel to automatically generate future values that are based on existing data, or to automatically generate extrapolated values that are based on linear trend or growth trend calculations. You can fill in a series of values that fit a simple linear trend or an exponential growth trend by using the fill handle or the Series command. To extend complex and nonlinear data, you can use worksheet functions or the regression analysis tool in the Analysis ToolPak Add-in. Although Goal Seek can accommodate only one variable, you can project backward for more variables by using the Solver add-in . By using Solver, you can find an optimal value for a formula in one cell—called the target cell—on a worksheet. Solver works with a group of cells that are related to the formula in the target cell. Solver adjusts the values in the changing cells that you specify—called the adjustable cells—to produce the result that you specify from the target cell formula. You can apply constraints to restrict the values that Solver can use in the model, and the constraints can refer to other cells that affect the target cell formula. Need more help?

Excel Import and analyze data PivotTables PivotTables Calculate values in a PivotTable Calculate values in a PivotTable Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel for the web Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less In PivotTables, you can use summary functions in value fields to combine values from the underlying source data. If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The PivotTable would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. Another way to calculate is to use Measures in Power Pivot, which you create using a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula. For more information, see Create a Measure in Power Pivot . About calculations Windows, Mac Web iPad \\ue70d PivotTables provide ways to calculate data. Learn about the calculation methods that are available, how calculations are affected by the type of source data, and how to use formulas in PivotTables and PivotCharts. Available calculation methods To calculate values in a PivotTable, you can use any or all of the following types of calculation methods: Summary functions in value fields The data in the values area summarize the underlying source data in the PivotTable. For example, the following source data: Produces the following PivotTables and PivotCharts. If you create a PivotChart from the data in a PivotTable, the values in that PivotChart reflect the calculations in the associated PivotTable report. In the PivotTable, the Month column field provides the items March and April . The Region row field provides the items North , South , East , and West . The value at the intersection of the April column and the North row is the total sales revenue from the records in the source data that have Month values of April and Region values of North . In a PivotChart, the Region field might be a category field that shows North , South , East , and West as categories. The Month field could be a series field that shows the items March , April , and May as series represented in the legend. A Values field named Sum of Sales could contain data markers that represent the total revenue in each region for each month. For example, one data marker would represent, by its position on the vertical (value) axis, the total sales for April in the North region. To calculate the value fields, the following summary functions are available for all types of source data except Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) source data. Function Summarizes Sum The sum of the values. This is the default function for numeric data. Count The number of data values. The Count summary function works the same as the COUNTA function . Count is the default function for data other than numbers. Average The average of the values. Max The largest value. Min The smallest value. Product The product of the values. Count Nums The number of data values that are numbers. The Count Nums summary function works the same as the COUNT function . StDev An estimate of the standard deviation of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StDevp The standard deviation of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Var An estimate of the variance of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Varp The variance of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Custom calculations A custom calculation shows values based on other items or cells in the data area. For example, you could display values in the Sum of Sales data field as a percentage of March sales, or as a running total of the items in the Month field. The following functions are available for custom calculations in value fields. Function Result No Calculation Displays the value that is entered in the field. % of Grand Total Displays values as a percentage of the grand total of all of the values or data points in the report. % of Column Total Displays all of the values in each column or series as a percentage of the total for the column or series. % of Row Total Displays the value in each row or category as a percentage of the total for the row or category. % Of Displays values as a percentage of the value of the Base item in the Base field . % of Parent Row Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item on rows) % of Parent Column Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item on columns) % of Parent Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item of the selected Base field ) Difference From Displays values as the difference from the value of the Base item in the Base field . % Difference From Displays values as the percentage difference from the value of the Base item in the Base field . Running Total in Displays the value for successive items in the Base field as a running total. % Running Total in Calculates the value for successive items in the Base field that are displayed as a running total as a percentage. Rank Smallest to Largest Displays the rank of selected values in a specific field, listing the smallest item in the field as 1, and each larger value will have a higher rank value. Rank Largest to Smallest Displays the rank of selected values in a specific field, listing the largest item in the field as 1, and each smaller value will have a higher rank value. Index Calculates values as follows: ((value in cell) x (Grand Total of Grand Totals)) / ((Grand Row Total) x (Grand Column Total)) Formulas If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The report would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. How the type of source data affects calculations Calculations and options that are available in a report depend on whether the source data came from an OLAP database or a non-OLAP data source. Calculations based on OLAP source data For PivotTables that are created from OLAP cubes, the summarized values are precalculated on the OLAP server before Excel displays the results. You cannot change how these precalculated values are calculated in the PivotTable. For example, you cannot change the summary function that is used to calculate data fields or subtotals, or add calculated fields or calculated items. Also, if the OLAP server provides calculated fields, known as calculated members, you will see these fields in the PivotTable Field List. You will also see any calculated fields and calculated items that are created by macros that were written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and stored in your workbook, but you won't be able to change these fields or items. If you need additional types of calculations, contact your OLAP database administrator. For OLAP source data, you can include or exclude the values for hidden items when calculating subtotals and grand totals. Calculations based on non-OLAP source data In PivotTables that are based on other types of external data or on worksheet data, Excel uses the Sum summary function to calculate value fields that contain numeric data, and the Count summary function to calculate data fields that contain text. You can choose a different summary function, such as, Average, Max, or Min, to further analyze and customize your data. You can also create your own formulas that use elements of the report or other worksheet data by creating a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Using formulas in PivotTables You can create formulas only in reports that are based on a non-OLAP source data. You cannot use formulas in reports that are based on an OLAP database. When you use formulas in PivotTables, you should know about the following formula syntax rules and formula behavior: PivotTable formula elements In formulas that you create for calculated fields and calculated items, you can use operators and expressions as you do in other worksheet formulas. You can use constants and refer to data from the report, but you cannot use cell references or defined names. You cannot use worksheet functions that require cell references or defined names as arguments, and you cannot use array functions. Field and item names Excel uses field and item names to identify those elements of a report in your formulas. In the following example, the data in range C3:C9 is using the field name Dairy . A calculated item in the Type field that estimates sales for a new product based on Dairy sales could use a formula such as =Dairy * 115% . Note: In a PivotChart, the field names are displayed in the PivotTable field list, and item names can be seen in each field drop-down list. Don't confuse these names with those you see in chart tips, which reflect series and data point names instead. Formulas operate on sum totals, not individual records Formulas for calculated fields operate on the sum of the underlying data for any fields in the formula. For example, the calculated field formula =Sales * 1.2 multiplies the sum of the sales for each type and region by 1.2; it does not multiply each individual sale by 1.2 and then sum the multiplied amounts. Formulas for calculated items operate on the individual records. For example, the calculated item formula =Dairy *115% multiplies each individual sale of Dairy times 115%, after which the multiplied amounts are summarized together in the Values area. Spaces, numbers, and symbols in names In a name that includes more than one field, the fields can be in any order. In the example above, cells C6:D6 can be 'April North' or 'North April' . Use single quotation marks around names that are more than one word or that include numbers or symbols. Totals Formulas cannot refer to totals (such as, March Total , April Total , and Grand Total in the example). Field names in item references You can include the field name in a reference to an item. The item name must be in square brackets — for example, Region[North] . Use this format to avoid #NAME? errors when two items in two different fields in a report have the same name. For example, if a report has an item named Meat in the Type field and another item named Meat in the Category field, you can prevent #NAME? errors by referring to the items as Type[Meat] and Category[Meat] . Referring to items by position You can refer to an item by its position in the report as currently sorted and displayed. Type[1] is Dairy , and Type[2] is Seafood . The item referred to in this way can change whenever the positions of items change or different items are displayed or hidden. Hidden items are not counted in this index. You can use relative positions to refer to items. The positions are determined relative to the calculated item that contains the formula. If South is the current region, Region[-1] is North ; if North is the current region, Region[+1] is South . For example, a calculated item could use the formula =Region[-1] * 3% . If the position that you give is before the first item or after the last item in the field, the formula results in a #REF! error. Using formulas in PivotCharts To use formulas in a PivotChart, you create the formulas in the associated PivotTable, where you can see the individual values that make up your data, and then you can view the results graphically in the PivotChart. For example, the following PivotChart shows sales for each salesperson per region: To see what sales would look like if they were increased by 10 percent, you could create a calculated field in the associated PivotTable that uses a formula such as =Sales * 110% . The result immediately appears in the PivotChart, as shown in the following chart: To see a separate data marker for sales in the North region minus a transportation cost of 8 percent, you could create a calculated item in the Region field with a formula such as =North – (North * 8%) . The resulting chart would look like this: However, a calculated item that is created in the Salesperson field would appear as a series represented in the legend and appear in the chart as a data point in each category. Create formulas in a PivotTable Important: You cannot create formulas in a PivotTable that is connected to an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data source. Before you start, decide whether you want a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Use a calculated field when you want to use the data from another field in your formula. Use a calculated item when you want your formula to use data from one or more specific items within a field. For calculated items, you can enter different formulas cell by cell. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCounty has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation. Add a calculated field Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, type a name for the field. In the Formula box, enter the formula for the field. To use the data from another field in the formula, click the field in the Fields box, and then click Insert Field . For example, to calculate a 15% commission on each value in the Sales field, you could enter = Sales * 15% . Click Add . Add a calculated item to a field Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. If items in the field are grouped, on the Analyze tab, in the Group group, click Ungroup . Click the field where you want to add the calculated item. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Item . In the Name box, type a name for the calculated item. In the Formula box, enter the formula for the item. To use the data from an item in the formula, click the item in the Items list, and then click Insert Item (the item must be from the same field as the calculated item). Click Add . Enter different formulas cell by cell for calculated items Click a cell for which you want to change the formula. To change the formula for several cells, hold down CTRL and click the additional cells. In the formula bar, type the changes to the formula. Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Solve Order . Click a formula, and then click Move Up or Move Down . Continue until the formulas are in the order that you want them to be calculated. View all formulas that are used in a PivotTable You can display a list of all the formulas that are used in the current PivotTable. Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . Edit a PivotTable formula Before you edit a formula, determine whether that formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. If the formula is in a calculated item, also determine whether the formula is the only one for the calculated item. For calculated items, you can edit individual formulas for specific cells of a calculated item. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCalc has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. Determine whether a formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . In the list of formulas, find the formula that you want to change listed under Calculated Field or Calculated Item. When there are multiple formulas for a calculated item, the default formula that was entered when the item was created has the calculated item name in column B. For additional formulas for a calculated item, column B contains both the calculated item name and the names of intersecting items. For example, you might have a default formula for a calculated item named MyItem , and another formula for this item identified as MyItem January Sales . In the PivotTable, you would find this formula in the Sales cell for the MyItem row and January column. Continue by using one of the following editing methods. Edit a calculated field formula Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, select the calculated field for which you want to change the formula. In the Formula box, edit the formula. Click Modify . Edit a single formula for a calculated item Click the field that contains the calculated item.

Tip: If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation. For more information, see Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas . Delete a PivotTable formula Note: Deleting a PivotTable formula removes it permanently. If you do not want to remove a formula permanently, you can hide the field or item instead by dragging it out of the PivotTable. Determine whether the formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. Calculated fields appear in the PivotTable Field List. Calculated items appear as items within other fields. Do one of the following: To delete a calculated field, click anywhere in the PivotTable. To delete a calculated item, in the PivotTable, click the field that contains the item that you want to delete. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field or Calculated Item . In the Name box, select the field or item that you want to delete. Click Delete . To summarize values in a PivotTable in Excel for the web, you can use summary functions like Sum, Count, and Average.

Access Queries Simple queries Simple queries Compare two tables in Access and find only matching data Compare two tables in Access and find only matching data Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less Sometimes you may want to review records from one Access table only if there are corresponding records in another Access table that contain one or more fields with matching data. For example, you may want to review the employee records of employees who have processed at least one order to determine which employees are eligible for a bonus. Or, you may want to review contact information for customers who live in the same city as an employee so that you can match employees with a customers for in-person meetings. When you want to compare two Access tables and find matching data, you can either: Create a query that joins fields from each table where those fields contain corresponding information, either by using an existing relationship or by using a join that you create for the purpose of the query. This method provides optimum performance (the speed with which the query returns results), but you cannot join fields that have dissimilar data types. Create a query that compares fields by using one field as a criterion for the other. Using a field as a criterion for another field is generally slower than using joins, because joins eliminate rows from a query's results before the underlying tables are read, whereas criteria are applied to a query's results after the underlying tables are read. However, you can use a field as a field criterion to compare fields that have dissimilar data types, which you cannot do by using joins. This article discusses how to compare two tables to identify matching data, and provides sample data that you can use with example procedures. What do you want to do? Compare two tables by using joins Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Compare two tables by using joins To compare two tables by using joins, you create a select query that includes both tables. If there is not already an existing relationship between the tables on the fields that contain the corresponding data, you create a join on the fields that you want to examine for matches. You can create as many joins as you want, but each pair of joined fields must be of the same or compatible data type. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a table that stores student major data and a table that stores class enrollment data. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors since the recent curriculum changes, you need to review records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. Prepare sample data In this example, you build a query that determines how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected math students' grades. You use the following two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments. Add these two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments, to a database. Access provides several ways to add these sample tables to a database. You can enter the data manually, you can copy each table into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Office Excel 2007), and then import the worksheets into Access, or you can paste the data into a text editor, such as Notepad, and then import the data from the resulting text files. The steps in this section explain how to enter data manually in a blank datasheet, and also explain how to copy the sample tables to Excel, and then import those tables into Access.

Enter the sample data manually Open a new or existing database. On the Create tab, in the Tables group, click Table . Access adds a new, blank table to your database. Note: You do not need to follow this step if you open a new, blank database, but you will need to follow it whenever you need to add a table to the database. Double-click the first cell in the header row, and then type the name of the field in the sample table. By default, Access denotes blank fields in the header row with the text Add New Field , such as: Use the arrow keys to move to the next blank header cell, and then type the second field name. (You can also double-click the new cell.) Repeat this step for each field name. Enter the data in the sample table. As you enter the data, Access infers a data type for each field. Each field has a specific data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time. Setting data types helps ensure accurate data entry and also helps prevent mistakes, such as using a telephone number in a calculation. For these sample tables, allow Access to infer the data type, but be sure to review the data type that Access infers for each field. After you finish entering the data, click Save , or press CTRL+S. The Save As dialog box appears. In the Table Name box, type the name of the sample table, and then click OK . You use the name of each sample table (for example, Student Majors) because the queries in the procedure sections of this article also use those names. After you finish entering the sample data, you are ready to compare the two tables . Skip the following section (Create the sample worksheets), unless you want to learn how to create a worksheet that is based on the sample data from the tables in the preceding section. Create the sample worksheets Start your spreadsheet program, and create a new, blank file. If you use Excel, a new, blank workbook is created by default when you start the program. Copy the first sample table from the preceding section and paste it into the first worksheet, starting at the first cell. Be sure that you copy the header row, because it contains the field names of the sample table. Using the technique provided by your spreadsheet program, give the worksheet the same name as the sample table. For example, when you paste the Class Enrollments sample data, name the worksheet Class Enrollments. Repeat steps 2 and 3, copying the second sample table to a blank worksheet and renaming the worksheet. Note: You may need to add worksheets to your spreadsheet file. For information about adding worksheets to your spreadsheet file, see the help for your spreadsheet program. Save the workbook to a convenient location on your computer or your network, and go to the next set of steps. Create database tables from the worksheets In a new or existing database: On the External Data tab, in the Import group, click Excel . -or- Click More , and then select a spreadsheet program from the list. The Get External Data - Program Name Spreadsheet dialog box appears. Click Browse , locate and open the spreadsheet file that you created in the previous steps, and then click OK . The Import Spreadsheet Wizard starts. By default, the wizard selects the first worksheet in the workbook (Student Majors, if you followed the steps in the previous section), and data from that worksheet appears in the lower section of the wizard page. Click Next . On the next page of the wizard, select the First Row Contains Column Headings check box, and then click Next . On the next page, you can use the text boxes and lists under Field Options to change field names and data types, or to omit fields from the import operation. For this example, you do not need to change anything. Click Next . On the next page, select the No primary key option, and then click Next . By default, Access applies the name of the worksheet to your new table. Accept the name in the Import to Table box, and then click Finish . On the Save Import Steps page, click Close to complete the wizard. Repeat steps 1 through 7 until you have created a table from each worksheet in the spreadsheet file. Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using joins Now you are ready to compare the Class Enrollments table and the Student Majors table. Because you have not defined relationships between the two tables, you need to create joins between the appropriate fields in the query. The tables have more than one field in common, and you will need to create a join for each pair of common fields: Student ID, Year, and Curriculum (Class Enrollments table) and Major (Student Majors table). In this example, you are only interested in math majors, so you will also use a field criterion to limit the query results. Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. On the Create tab, click Query Design . Double-click the table that contains the records that you want to display — in this example, the Class Enrollments table, and then double-click the table to which you are comparing it — in this example, the Student Majors table. Drag the Student ID field from the Class Enrollments table to the Student ID field of the Student Majors table. A line appears between the two tables in the design grid, indicating that you have created a join. Double-click the line to open the Join Properties dialog box. Review the three options in the Join Properties dialog box. By default, option 1 is selected. In some cases, you need to adjust the join properties to include extra rows from one table. Because you are trying to find only matching data, leave the join set to option 1. Close the Join Properties dialog box by clicking Cancel . You will need to create two other joins. Create these joins by dragging the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then by dragging the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field on the Student Majors table. In the Class Enrollments table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) to add all of the table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column in the query design grid. In the Criteria row of the Major column, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Sometimes you may want to compare tables on the basis of fields that have matching data, but have different data types. For example, a field in one table may have a Number data type, and you want to compare that field to a field in another table that has a Text data type. Fields that contain similar data yet have different field types can result when numbers are stored as text, either by design, or for other reasons, such as importing data from another program. Because you cannot create joins between fields that have different data types, you will need to use a different method to compare the fields. You can compare two fields that have different data types by using one field as a criterion for the other. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a Student Majors table and a Class Enrollments table. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors, you need to look at records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. However, one of the fields that you want to use to compare the tables has a different data type from its counterpart. To compare two tables by using a field as a criterion, you create a select query that includes both tables. You include the fields that you want to display, and you also include the field that corresponds to the field that you want to use as a criterion. You then create a criterion to compare the tables. You can create as many criteria to compare fields as you want. To illustrate this method, you will use the sample tables from the previous section , but you will change the data type of the Student ID field of the sample Student Majors table from Number to Text. Because you cannot create a join between two fields that have different data types, you will have to compare the two Student ID fields by using one field as a criterion for the other. Change the data type of the Student Majors Student ID field Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. In the Navigation Pane , right-click the Student Majors table, and then click Design View on the shortcut menu. The Student Majors table opens in Design view. In the Data Type column, change the setting for Student ID from Number to Text . Close the Student Majors table. When you are prompted to save changes, click Yes . Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using a field criterion The following procedure shows how to compare the two Student ID fields by using the field from Class Enrollments as a criterion for the field from Student Majors. By using the Like keyword, you can compare the fields, even though they have different data types. On the Create tab, in the Other group, click Query Design . Double-click Class Enrollments , and then double-click Student Majors . Drag the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then drag the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field of the Student Majors table. Because these fields have the same data types, you can compare them by using joins. Joins are the preferred method for comparing fields that have the same data type. Double-click the asterisk ( * ) on the Class Enrollments table to add all of that table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Student ID field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Student ID column of the design grid. In the Criteria row of the Student ID column, type Like [Class Enrollments].[Student ID] . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column of the design grid. In the Criteria row, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Need more help? Want more options?

Access Queries Advanced queries Advanced queries Add records to a table by using an append query Add records to a table by using an append query Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less This article explains how to create and run an append query. You use an append query when you need to add new records to an existing table by using data from other sources. If you need to change data in an existing set of records, such as updating the value of a field, you can use an update query. If you need to make a new table from a selection of data, or to merge two tables into one new table, you can use a make-table query. For more information about update queries or make-table queries, or for general information about other ways to add records to a database or change existing data, see the See Also section. In this article Overview Create and run an append query Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query Overview An append query selects records from one or more data sources and copies the selected records to an existing table. For example, suppose that you acquire a database that contains a table of potential new customers, and that you already have a table in your existing database that stores that kind of data. You\\'d like to store the data in one place, so you decide to copy it from the new database into your existing table. To avoid entering the new data manually, you can use an append query to copy the records. Benefits of using an append query By using a query to copy data, you can: Append multiple records in one pass If you copy data manually, you usually have to perform multiple copy/paste operations. By using a query, you select all the data at once, and then copy it. Review your selection before you copy it You can view your selection in Datasheet view and can make adjustments to your selection as needed before you copy the data. This can be particularly handy if your query includes criteria or expressions, and you need several tries to get it just right. You cannot undo an append query. If you make a mistake, you must either restore your database from a backup or correct your error, either manually or by using a delete query. Use criteria to refine your selection For example, you might want to only append records of customers who live in your city. Append records when some of the fields in the data sources don\\'t exist in the destination table For example, suppose that your existing customer table has eleven fields, and the new table that you want to copy from only has nine of those eleven fields. You can use an append query to copy the data from the nine fields that match and leave the other two fields blank. Basic steps of an append query The process of creating an append query follows these basic steps: Create a select query You start by selecting the data that you want to copy. You can adjust your select query as needed, and run it as many times as you want to make sure you are selecting the data that you want to copy. Convert the select query to an append query After your selection is ready, you change the query type to Append . Choose the destination fields for each column in the append query In some cases, Access automatically chooses the destination fields for you. You can adjust the destination fields, or choose them if Access did not. Preview and run the query to append the records Before you append the records, you can switch to Datasheet view for a preview of the appended records. Important: You cannot undo an append query. Consider backing up your database or the destination table. Create and run an append query In this section Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query Step 3: Choose the destination fields Step 4: Preview and run the append query Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Open the database that contains the records that you want to copy. On the Create tab, in the Queries group, click Query Design . Double-click the tables or queries that contain the records that you want to copy, and then click Close . The tables or queries appear as one or more windows in the query designer. Each window lists the fields in a table or query. This figure shows a typical table in the query designer. 1. Assets table shown in the query designer 2. Query design grid Double-click each field that you want to append. The selected fields appear in the Field row in the query design grid. The data types of the fields in the source table must be compatible with the data types of the fields in the destination table. Text fields are compatible with most other types of fields. Number fields are only compatible with other number fields. For example, you can append numbers to a text field, but you cannot append text into a number field. You can also use an expression as a field — such as =Date() to automatically return today\\'s date — and you can use expressions with table or query fields in the design grid to customize the data that you select. For example, if your destination table has a field that stores a four-digit year and the source table has a regular date/time field, you might use the DatePart function with the source field to select only the year. To quickly add all the fields in a table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) at the top of the list of table fields. This figure shows the design grid with all fields added. Optionally, you can enter one or more criteria in the Criteria row of the design grid. The following table shows some example criteria and explains the effect they have on a query. Criteria Effect > 234 Returns all numbers greater than 234. To find all numbers less than 234, use < 234. >= \"Callahan\" Returns all records from Callahan through the end of the alphabet. Between #2/2/2017# And #12/1/2017# Returns dates from 2-Feb-17 through 1-Dec-17 (ANSI-89). If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard characters, use single quotation marks (\\') instead of pound signs. Example: Between \\'2/2/2017\\' And \\'12/1/2017\\'. Not \"Germany\" Finds all records where the exact contents of the field are not exactly equal to \"Germany.\" The criterion will return records that contain characters in addition to \"Germany,\" such as \"Germany (euro)\" or \"Europe (Germany)\". Not \"T*\" Finds all records except those beginning with T. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign ( % ) instead of the asterisk ( * ). Not \"*t\" Finds all records that do not end with t. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. In(Canada,UK) In a list, finds all records containing Canada or UK. Like \"[A-D]*\" In a Text field, finds all records that start with the letters A through D. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. Like \"*ar*\" Finds all records that include the letter sequence \"ar\". If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. Like \"Maison Dewe?\" Finds all records that begin with \"Maison\" and that also contain a 5-letter second string in which the first 4 letters are \"Dewe\" and the last letter is unknown (indicated by a question mark). If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the underscore ( _ ) instead of the question mark. #2/2/2017# Finds all records for February 2, 2017. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, surround the date with single quotation marks instead of pound signs ( # ). Example: \\'2/2/2017\\'. < Date() - 30 Returns all dates more than 30 days old. Date() Returns all records containing today\\'s date. Between Date() And DateAdd(\"M\", 3, Date()) Returns all records between today\\'s date and three months from today\\'s date. Is Null Returns all records that contain a null (blank or undefined) value. Is Not Null Returns all records that contain a value. \"\" Returns all records that contain a zero-length string. You use zero-length strings when you need to add a value to a required field, but you don\\'t yet know what that value is. For example, a field may require a fax number, but some of your customers may not have fax machines. In that case, you enter a pair of double quotation marks with no space between them (\"\") instead of a number. On the Query Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . Verify that the query returned the records that you want to copy. If you need to add or remove fields from the query, switch back to Design view and add fields as described in the preceding step, or select the fields that you don\\'t want and press DELETE to remove them from the query. Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query On the Home tab, in the View group, click View , and then click Design View . On the Query Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Append . The Append dialog box appears. Next, you specify whether to append records to a table in the current database, or to a table in a different database. Do one of the following: In the Append dialog box, click Current Database , select the destination table from the Table Name combo box, and then click OK . -or- In the Append dialog box, click Another Database . In the File Name box, enter the location and name of the destination database. In the Table Name combo box, enter the name of the destination table, and then click OK . Step 3: Choose the destination fields The way that you choose destination fields depends on how you created your select query in Step 1. If you... Access... Added all the fields from your source table or query Adds all the fields in the destination table to the Append to row in the design grid Added individual fields to the query or used expressions, and the field names in the source and destination tables match Automatically adds the matching destination fields to the Append to row in the query Added individual fields or used expressions, and any of the names in the source and destination tables don\\'t match Adds the matching fields, and leaves unmatched fields blank If Access leaves fields blank, you can click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. This figure illustrates how you click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. Note: If you leave the destination field blank, the query will not append data to that field. Step 4: Preview and run the append query To preview your changes, switch to Datasheet view. Tip: To quickly switch views, right-click the tab at the top of the query, and then click the view that you want. Return to Design view, and then click Run to append the records. Note: While running a query that returns a large amount of data you might get an error message indicating that you will not be able to undo the query. Try increasing the limit on the memory segment to 3MB to allow the query to go through. Top of Page Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query If you try to run an append query and it seems like nothing happens, check the Access status bar for the following message: This action or event has been blocked by Disabled Mode. To fix this, click Enable Content in the Message Bar to enable the query. Note: When you enable the append query, you also enable all other database content. If you don\\'t see the Message Bar, it may be hidden. You can show it, unless it has also been disabled. If the Message Bar has been disabled, you can enable it.

Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less The Relationships window lets you define relationship between items stored in multiple Access tables. It is available by clicking Database Tools > Relationships . Relationships are like the rules that govern how data is connected in your database. In a well-normalized order-processing database, for example, most likely you’ll have customer information in one table and order information in another table. You want to make sure customers don’t get separated from their orders, right? And you don’t want an order to be created that doesn’t have a valid customer connected to it. The Relationships window is where you go to set these rules so that they apply throughout your database. If you’ve built an Access query before, you’ll notice that the Relationships window looks a lot like the top part of the Query Builder: In the Relationships window, you use the commands on the Design tab to add tables to the view, and then you drag fields between tables to set up the relationships. In this example, the relationship allows for multiple orders to be connected to each customer, but it keeps you from creating an order for a customer that doesn’t exist. Once you set up these rules in the Relationships window, they’ll apply to the whole database (for example, if you create a new query, the joins will automatically be set up according to your relationship rules). Note: Deleting a table from the Relationships window won’t delete it from your database, nor will it remove relationships that you’ve already established. Things you can do Task How to do it Add a table or query to the window Click Design > Add Tables ( Show Table in Access 2013), select the table or query you want, and then click Add . Delete a table or query from the window Select the table or query, and then press DELETE. Hide a table or query Right-click the table or query, and then click Hide Table . Create a relationship Drag a field from one table or query to the corresponding field in the other table or query. Set properties for a relationship Right-click the relationship line between two tables (this can take a few tries to hit it exactly right), and then click Edit Relationship . Delete a relationship Right-click the relationship line between two tables (this can take a few tries to hit it exactly right), and then click Delete . Show all relationships Click Design > All Relationships . View the relationships for a particular table Select the table, and then click Design > Direct Relationships . View the relationships for one table without viewing the relationships for other tables Click Design > Tools > Clear Layout . Add the table you want to see relationships for ( Design > Relationships > Add Tables ( Show Table in Access 2013),) and then click Design > Relationships > Direct Relationships . Adjust a table size to reveal additional fields and relationships. Note Requires Access for Microsoft 365. To automatically size the table, right click a table and select Size to Fit. Or, double-click a table edge on the: Right to size horizontally based on field name length. Bottom to size vertically based on the number of fields. Bottom right corner to auto-adjust the table size, both horizontally and vertically (the equivalent of Size to Fit ). Select a subset of tables Note Requires Access for Microsoft 365. To help you focus upon certain tables and their relationships: CTRL + (select multiple tables). Click and drag a box completely around the selected range. Both these actions highlight the subset of tables with a thicker border. To unselect, click outside the selection. To move the selection, click and drag to another location.

Use the Name Manager in Excel Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Use the Name Manager dialog box to work with all the defined names and table names in a workbook. For example, you may want to find names with errors, confirm the value and reference of a name, view or edit descriptive comments, or determine the scope. You can also sort and filter the list of names, and easily add, change, or delete names from one location. To open the Name Manager dialog box, on the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Name Manager . The Name Manager dialog box displays the following information about each name in a list box: Column Name Description Name One of the following: A defined name, which is indicated by a defined name icon. A table name, which is indicated by a table name icon. Note: A table name is the name for an Excel table, which is a collection of data about a particular subject stored in records (rows) and fields (columns). Excel creates a default Excel table name of Table1, Table2, and so on, each time you insert an Excel table. You can change a table\\'s name to make it more meaningful. For more information about Excel tables, see Using structured references with Excel tables . Value The current value of the name, such as the results of a formula, a string constant, a cell range, an error, an array of values, or a placeholder if the formula cannot be evaluated. The following are representative examples: \"this is my string constant\" 3.1459 {2003;12,2002;23,;2001,18} #REF! {...} Refers To The current reference for the name. The following are representative examples: =Sheet1!$A$3 =8.3 =HR!$A$1:$Z$345 =SUM(Sheet1!A1,Sheet2!B2) Scope A worksheet name, if the scope is the local worksheet level. \"Workbook,\" if the scope is the global workbook level. This is the default option. Comment Additional information about the name up to 255 characters. The following are representative examples: This value will expire on May 2, 2007. Don\\'t delete! Critical name! Based on the ISO certification exam numbers. Refers to: The reference for the selected name. You can quickly edit the range of a name by modifying the details in the Refers to box. After making the change you can click Commit to save changes, or click Cancel to discard your changes. Notes: You cannot use the Name Manager dialog box while you are changing the contents of a cell. The Name Manager dialog box does not display names defined in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), or hidden names (the Visible property of the name is set to False). Create a named range On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Define Name . In the New Name dialog box, in the Name box, type the name you want to use for your reference. Note: Names can be up to 255 characters in length. The scope automatically defaults to Workbook . To change the name’s scope, in the Scope drop-down list box, select the name of a worksheet. Optionally, in the Comment box, enter a descriptive comment up to 255 characters. In the Refers to box, do one of the following: Click Collapse Dialog (which temporarily shrinks the dialog box), select the cells on the worksheet, and then click Expand Dialog . To enter a constant, type = (equal sign) and then type the constant value. To enter a formula, type = and then type the formula. Tips: Be careful about using absolute or relative references in your formula. If you create the reference by clicking on the cell you want to refer to, Excel will create an absolute reference, such as \"Sheet1!$B$1\". If you type a reference, such as \"B1\", it is a relative reference. If your active cell is A1 when you define the name, then the reference to \"B1\" really means \"the cell in the next column\". If you use the defined name in a formula in a cell, the reference will be to the cell in the next column relative to where you enter the formula. For example, if you enter the formula in C10, the reference would be D10, and not B1. More information - Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references To finish and return to the worksheet, click OK . Note: To make the New Name dialog box wider or longer, click and drag the grip handle at the bottom. Edit a name If you modify a defined name or table name, all uses of that name in the workbook are also changed. On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Name Manager . In the Name Manager dialog box, double-click the name you want to edit, or, click the name that you want to change, and then click Edit . In the Edit Name dialog box, in the Name box, type the new name for the reference. In the Refers to box, change the reference, and then click OK . In the Name Manager dialog box, in the Refers to box, change the cell, formula, or constant represented by the name. Delete one or more names On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Name Manager . In the Name Manager dialog box, click the name that you want to change. Select one or more names by doing one of the following: To select a name, click it. To select more than one name in a contiguous group, click and drag the names, or press SHIFT and click the mouse button for each name in the group. To select more than one name in a noncontiguous group, press CTRL and click the mouse button for each name in the group. Click Delete . Click OK to confirm the deletion. Filter names Use the commands in the Filter drop-down list to quickly display a subset of names. Selecting each command toggles the filter operation on or off, making it easy to combine or remove different filter operations to get the results you want. You can filter from the following options: Select To Names Scoped To Worksheet Display only those names that are local to a worksheet. Names Scoped To Workbook Display only those names that are global to a workbook. Names With Errors Display only those names with values containing errors (such as #REF, #VALUE, or #NAME). Names Without Errors Display only those names with values that do not contain errors. Defined Names Display only names defined by you or by Excel, such as a print area. Table Names Display only table names. Sort names To sort the list of names in ascending or descending order, click the column header. Resize columns To automatically size the column to fit the longest value in that column, double-click the right side of the column header. Need more help?

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Access Tables Creating tables Creating tables Introduction to tables Introduction to tables Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less Tables are essential objects in a database because they hold all the information or data. For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables in Access, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need. For an introduction to planning and designing a database, see Database design basics . In this article Overview Table and field properties Data Types Table relationships Keys Benefits of using relationships Overview A relational database like Access usually has several related tables. In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com . Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. You must set a field's data type when you create the field. You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon. Examples of automatic data type detection The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view. If you enter: Access creates a field with a data type of: John Short Text http://www.contoso.com You can use any valid Internet protocol prefix. For example, http://, https://, and mailto: are valid prefixes. Hyperlink 1 Number, Long Integer 50,000 Number, Long Integer 50,000.99 Number, Double 50000.389 Number, Double 12/67 The date and time formats recognized are those of your user locale.

Currency 21.75 Number, Double 123.00% Number, Double 3.46E+03 Number, Double Top of Page Table relationships Although each table stores data about a different subject, tables in an Access database usually store data about subjects that are related to each other. For example, a database might contain: A customers table that lists your company’s customers and their addresses. A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item. An orders table that tracks customer orders. Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common. For more information, see Guide to table relationships . Top of Page Keys Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys: Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key . Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table. The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID. To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order's customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table. 1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name. 2. A foreign key — note the absence of the key icon. Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. Top of Page Benefits of using relationships Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits: Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer's name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data. Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don't use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance. Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

For example, a database might contain: A customers table that lists your company’s customers and their addresses. A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item. An orders table that tracks customer orders. Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common. For more information, see Guide to table relationships . Top of Page Keys Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys: Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key . Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-tables-78ff21ea-2f76-4fb0-8af6-c318d1ee0ea7', 'ind': 2}, 'id': '0fe42cb1-2389-44be-bbf4-938308b5f077_3'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': \"table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table. The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID. To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order's customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table. 1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name. 2. A foreign key — note the absence of the key icon. Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. Top of Page Benefits of using relationships Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits: Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer's name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data. Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don't use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance. Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

The power of a relational database lies in combining data across tables. To do that, you first need to establish relationships between your tables. Then, put Access to work to combine data in queries, forms, and reports. To see all existing relationships defined for a database, open an Access template, go to the Database Tools tab, and select Relationships . Note: If you open a blank database or haven’t defined any table relationships, Access prompts you to add a table or query. Before you can add a relationship, you need at least two tables. Ideally, you build all of your tables first. To learn more, see Create relationships with the Lookup Wizard and Create relationships with the Relationships Pane . Understanding the Relationships view The lines in the Relationships view indicate connections between the tables. In the following image, the table on the left is the parent table. The table on the right is the child table. The line between them connects the fields (in this case, Order ID and Product ID) used to match data. Lines and symbols show you how your tables are related: A thick connecting line means you’re enforcing referential data integrity. That’s good. It keeps your data synced. In our illustration, the number 1 indicates that there can be only one matching record in that table. In the Orders table shown here, only one record matches each order. The ∞ symbol indicates that many records can include the same ID. In the Order Details table shown here, an order (indicated by its order ID) may appear more than once, because the same order may include multiple products. Types of relationships between tables There are three types of relationships between tables: One-to-one . When each item in each table only appears once. For example, each employee can have only one company car to use. For more information, see Create one-to-one relationships . One-to-many . When one item in one table can have a relationship to multiple items in another table. For example, each purchase order can include multiple products. Many-to-many . When one or more items in one table can have a relationship to one or more items in another table. For example, each order can have multiple products, and each product can appear on many orders. To find out more, see Create many-to-many relationships . One-to-many relationships One of the most common relationships between tables in well-designed databases is the one-to-many relationship. Relationships between tables normally rely on the primary key in one of the tables. Recall that the primary key is a unique identifier (often numeric) for each record. To show that the information in two different tables is related, you usually create a relationship using the primary key from one of the tables. In the relationship shown here, for example, each person in the Contacts table has an ID, which is the primary key (indicated by the key symbol next to it). That ID also appears in the Owner field in the Assets table. To email the person associated with an asset, get the value from the Email Address field. To do so, look for the value in the Owner field of the Asset table and then search for that ID in the Contacts table. The number 1 at one end of the connecting line and the ∞ symbol at the other end indicate that this is a one-to-many relationship, so one contact might be associated with many assets. Edit a relationship If you are modifying an existing database or if you created your database from a template, you can edit the existing relationships to meet your needs. Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . On the Design tab, select Edit Relationships . Table/Query is the parent table on the left (in this example, Customers). Related Table/Query is the child table (in this example, Orders). Even if the tables don’t appear in this order in the Relationships view, their placement in the dialog box indicates the direction of the line connecting them and the relationship. That’s important if, for example, it’s a one-to-many relationship, because it indicates that the table on the left is the one (the parent table) and the table on the right is the many (the child table). To change the fields that connect the tables, select a different field below each table shown. In this example, the ID field in the Customers table connects to the Customer ID field in the Orders table. Change the way Access synchronizes your data between tables. Enforce Referential Integrity To prevent invalid data and to keep references in sync across table relationships, select this. For example, suppose you have a one-to-one relationship between the Employees and Employee Benefits tables. If an employee leaves the company and you remove them from your Employees table, the related employee record in the Employee Benefits table is removed, too. Sometimes enforcing referential integrity doesn’t make sense. For example, suppose you have a one-to-many relationship between Shippers and Orders. You delete a shipper, and that shipper maps to orders in the Orders table. Those orders become orphans, meaning that they still contain a Shipper ID, but the ID is no longer valid because the record that it references no longer exists. Cascade Update Related Fields To make sure that data in related fields is updated in all the related tables, select this. For example, suppose you simply want to change the ID of a shipper. Setting this option ensures that the Shipper ID is updated—not just in the Shipper table but also in any other tables connected to it that also include that Shipper ID, such as the Orders table. Cascade Delete Related Records The decision to select this depends on whether you need to retain records in some tables even though they might be deleted from other tables. For example, suppose you delete a shipper. If this option is selected, Access deletes all records in all tables that reference that Shipper ID, including all orders (in the Orders table) shipped by that shipper. You only select this option if you are sure you want your order history deleted. To change the relationship between the tables from an inner join to an outer join, select the Join Type button. For more information, see Create queries with outer joins . Delete a table relationship Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. To remove a table relationship: Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting the two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . Select the Delete key. If you’re prompted to verify that you want to delete the relationship, select Yes . Note: When you remove a relationship, you also remove referential integrity support for that relationship, if any. As a result, Access will no longer prevent changes that result in orphan records on the many side of a one-to-many relationship. Want more? Create, edit or delete a relationship Need more help?

Using structured references with Excel tables Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel 2021 Excel 2021 for Mac Excel 2019 Excel 2019 for Mac Excel 2016 Excel 2013 Excel Mobile More... Less When you create an Excel table , Excel assigns a name to the table, and to each column header in the table. When you add formulas to an Excel table, those names can appear automatically as you enter the formula and select the cell references in the table instead of manually entering them. Here\\'s an example of what Excel does: Instead of using explicit cell references Excel uses table and column names =Sum(C2:C7) =SUM(DeptSales[Sales Amount]) That combination of table and column names is called a structured reference. The names in structured references adjust whenever you add or remove data from the table. Structured references also appear when you create a formula outside of an Excel table that references table data. The references can make it easier to locate tables in a large workbook. To include structured references in your formula, click the table cells you want to reference instead of typing their cell reference in the formula. Let’s use the following example data to enter a formula that automatically uses structured references to calculate the amount of a sales commission. Sales Person Region Sales Amount % Commission Commission Amount Joe North 260 10% Robert South 660 15% Michelle East 940 15% Erich West 410 12% Dafna North 800 15% Rob South 900 15% Copy the sample data in the table above, including the column headings, and paste it into cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet. To create the table, select any cell within the data range, and press Ctrl+T . Make sure the My table has headers box is checked, and click OK . In cell E2, type an equal sign ( = ), and click cell C2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[Sales Amount]] appears after the equal sign. Type an asterisk ( * ) directly after the closing bracket, and click cell D2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[% Commission]] appears after the asterisk. Press Enter . Excel automatically creates a calculated column and copies the formula down the entire column for you, adjusting it for each row. What happens when I use explicit cell references? If you enter explicit cell references in a calculated column, it can be harder to see what the formula is calculating. In your sample worksheet, click cell E2 In the formula bar, enter =C2*D2 and press Enter . Notice that while Excel copies your formula down the column, it doesn\\'t use structured references. If, for example, you add a column between the existing columns C and D, you\\'d have to revise your formula. How do I change a table name? When you create an Excel table, Excel creates a default table name (Table1, Table2, and so on), but you can change the table name to make it more meaningful. Select any cell in the table to show the Table Tools > Design tab on the ribbon. Type the name you want in the Table Name box, and press Enter . In our example data, we used the name DeptSales . Use the following rules for table names: Use valid characters Always start a name with a letter, an underscore character ( _ ), or a backslash ( \\\\ ). Use letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters for the rest of the name. You can’t use \"C\", \"c\", \"R\", or \"r\" for the name, because they’re already designated as a shortcut for selecting the column or row for the active cell when you enter them in the Name or Go To box. Don’t use cell references Names can’t be the same as a cell reference, such as Z$100 or R1C1. Don’t use a space to separate words Spaces can’t be used in the name. You can use the underscore character ( _ ) and period ( . ) as word separators. For example, DeptSales, Sales_Tax or First.Quarter. Use no more than 255 characters A table name can have up to 255 characters. Use unique table names Duplicate names aren’t allowed. Excel doesn’t distinguish between upper and lowercase characters in names so if you enter “Sales” but already have another name called “SALES\" in the same workbook, you’ll be prompted to choose a unique name. Use an object identifier If you plan on having a mix of tables, PivotTables and charts, it\\'s a good idea to prefix your names with the object type. For example: tbl_Sales for a sales table, pt_Sales for a sales PivotTable, and chrt_Sales for a sales chart, or ptchrt_Sales for a sales PivotChart. This keeps all of your names in an ordered list in the Name Manager . Structured reference syntax rules You can also enter or change structured references manually in the formula but to do that, it will help to understand structured reference syntax. Let’s go over the following formula example: =SUM(DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]],DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]]) This formula has the following structured reference components: Table name: DeptSales is a custom table name. It references the table data, without any header or total rows. You can use a default table name, such as Table1, or change it to use a custom name. Column specifier: [Sales Amount] and [Commission Amount ] are column specifiers that use the names of the columns they represent. They reference the column data, without any column header or total row. Always enclose specifiers in brackets as shown. Item specifier: [#Totals] and [#Data] are special item specifiers that refer to specific portions of the table, such as the total row. Table specifier: [[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and [[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are table specifiers that represent the outer portions of the structured reference. Outer references follow the table name, and you enclose them in square brackets. Structured reference: (DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are structured references, represented by a string that begins with the table name and ends with the column specifier. To create or edit structured references manually, use these syntax rules: Use brackets around specifiers All table, column, and special item specifiers need to be enclosed in matching brackets ([ ]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer matching brackets to enclose the inner matching brackets of the other specifiers. For example: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All column headers are text strings But they don’t require quotes when they’re used in a structured reference. Numbers or dates, such as 2014 or 1/1/2014, are also considered text strings. You can’t use expressions with column headers. For example, the expression DeptSalesFYSummary[[2014]:[2012]] won’t work. Use brackets around column headers with special characters If there are special characters, the entire column header needs to be enclosed in brackets, which means that double brackets are required in a column specifier. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[[Total $ Amount]] Here’s the list of special characters that need extra brackets in the formula: Tab Line feed Carriage return Comma (,) Colon (:) Period (.) Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign (#) Single quotation mark (\\') Double quotation mark (\") Left brace ({) Right brace (}) Dollar sign ($) Caret (^) Ampersand (&) Asterisk (*) Plus sign (+) Equal sign (=) Minus sign (-) Greater than symbol (>) Less than symbol (<) Division sign (/) At sign (@) Backslash (\\\\) Exclamation point (!) Left parenthesis (() Right parenthesis ()) Percent sign (%) Question mark (?) Backtick (`) Semicolon (;) Tilde (~) Underscore (_) Use an escape character for some special characters in column headers Some characters have special meaning and require the use of a single quotation mark (\\') as an escape character. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[\\'#OfItems] Here’s the list of special characters that need an escape character (\\') in the formula: Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign(#) Single quotation mark (\\') At sign (@) Use the space character to improve readability in a structured reference You can use space characters to improve the readability of a structured reference. For example: =DeptSales[ [Sales Person]:[Region] ] or =DeptSales[[#Headers], [#Data], [% Commission]] It’s recommended to use one space: After the first left bracket ([) Preceding the last right bracket (]). After a comma. Reference operators For more flexibility in specifying ranges of cells, you can use the following reference operators to combine column specifiers. This structured reference: Refers to: By using the: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All of the cells in two or more adjacent columns : (colon) range operator A2:B7 =DeptSales[Sales Amount],DeptSales[Commission Amount] A combination of two or more columns , (comma) union operator C2:C7, E2:E7 =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Sales Amount]] DeptSales[[Region]:[% Commission]] The intersection of two or more columns (space) intersection operator B2:C7 Special item specifiers To refer to specific portions of a table, such as just the totals row, you can use any of the following special item specifiers in your structured references. This special item specifier: Refers to: #All The entire table, including column headers, data, and totals (if any). #Data Just the data rows. #Headers Just the header row. #Totals Just the total row. If none exists, then it returns null. #This Row or @ or @[Column Name] Just the cells in the same row as the formula. These specifiers can’t be combined with any other special item specifiers. Use them to force implicit intersection behavior for the reference or to override implicit intersection behavior and refer to single values from a column. Excel automatically changes #This Row specifiers to the shorter @ specifier in tables that have more than one row of data. But if your table has only one row, Excel doesn’t replace the #This Row specifier, which may cause unexpected calculation results when you add more rows. To avoid calculation problems, make sure you enter multiple rows in your table before you enter any structured reference formulas. Qualifying structured references in calculated columns When you create a calculated column, you often use a structured reference to create the formula. This structured reference can be unqualified or fully qualified. For example, to create the calculated column, called Commission Amount, that calculates the amount of commission in dollars, you can use the following formulas: Type of structured reference Example Comment Unqualified =[Sales Amount]*[% Commission] Multiplies the corresponding values from the current row. Fully qualified =DeptSales[Sales Amount]*DeptSales[% Commission] Multiples the corresponding values for each row for both columns. The general rule to follow is this: If you’re using structured references within a table, such as when you create a calculated column, you can use an unqualified structured reference, but if you use the structured reference outside of the table, you need to use a fully qualified structured reference. Examples of using structured references Here are some ways to use structured references. This structured reference: Refers to: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]] All the cells in the Sales Amount column. C1:C8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[% Commission]] The header of the % Commission column. D1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Region]] The total of the Region column. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. B8 =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]:[% Commission]] All the cells in Sales Amount and % Commission. C1:D8 =DeptSales[[#Data],[% Commission]:[Commission Amount]] Just the data of the % Commission and Commission Amount columns. D2:E7 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[Region]:[Commission Amount]] Just the headers of the columns between Region and Commission Amount. B1:E1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]:[Commission Amount]] The totals of the Sales Amount through Commission Amount columns. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. C8:E8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[#Data],[% Commission]] Just the header and the data of % Commission. D1:D7 =DeptSales[[#This Row], [Commission Amount]] or =DeptSales[@Commission Amount] The cell at the intersection of the current row and the Commission Amount column. If used in the same row as a header or total row, this will return a #VALUE! error. If you type the longer form of this structured reference (#This Row) in a table with multiple rows of data, Excel automatically replaces it with the shorter form (@). They both work the same. E5 (if the current row is 5) Strategies for working with structured references Consider the following when you work with structured references. Use Formula AutoComplete You may find that using Formula AutoComplete is very useful when you enter structured references and to ensure the use of correct syntax. For more information, see Use Formula AutoComplete . Decide whether to generate structured references for tables in semi-selections By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi-selects the cells and automatically enters a structured reference instead of the cell range in the formula. This semi-selection behavior makes it much easier to enter a structured reference. You can turn this behavior on or off by selecting or clearing the Use table names in formulas check box in the File > Options > Formulas > Working with formulas dialog. Use workbooks with external links to Excel tables in other workbooks If a workbook contains an external link to an Excel table in another workbook, that linked source workbook must be open in Excel to avoid #REF! errors in the destination workbook that contains the links. If you open the destination workbook first and #REF! errors appear, they will be resolved if you then open the source workbook. If you open the source workbook first, you should see no error codes. Convert a range to a table and a table to a range When you convert a table to a range, all cell references change to their equivalent absolute A1 style references. When you convert a range to a table, Excel doesn’t automatically change any cell references of this range to their equivalent structured references. Turn off column headers You can toggle table column headers on and off from the table Design tab > Header Row . If you turn off table column headers, structured references that use column names aren’t affected, and you can still use them in formulas. Structured references that refer directly to the table headers (e.g. =DeptSales[[#Headers],[%Commission]] ) will result in #REF . Add or delete columns and rows to the table Because table data ranges often change, cell references for structured references adjust automatically. For example, if you use a table name in a formula to count all the data cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts. Rename a table or column If you rename a column or table, Excel automatically changes the use of that table and column header in all structured references that are used in the workbook. Move, copy, and fill structured references All structured references remain the same when you copy or move a formula that uses a structured reference. Note: Copying a structured reference and doing a fill of a structured reference are not the same thing. When you copy, all the structured references remain the same, while when you fill a formula, fully qualified structured references adjust the column specifiers like a series as summarized in the following table. If the fill direction is: And while filling, you press: Then: Up or down Nothing There is no column specifier adjustment. Up or down Ctrl Column specifiers adjust like a series. Right or left None Column specifiers adjust like a series. Up, down, right, or left Shift Instead of overwriting values in current cells, current cell values are moved and column specifiers are inserted. Need more help?

Structured reference: (DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are structured references, represented by a string that begins with the table name and ends with the column specifier. To create or edit structured references manually, use these syntax rules: Use brackets around specifiers All table, column, and special item specifiers need to be enclosed in matching brackets ([ ]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer matching brackets to enclose the inner matching brackets of the other specifiers. For example: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All column headers are text strings But they don’t require quotes when they’re used in a structured reference. Numbers or dates, such as 2014 or 1/1/2014, are also considered text strings. You can’t use expressions with column headers. For example, the expression DeptSalesFYSummary[[2014]:[2012]] won’t work. Use brackets around column headers with special characters If there are special characters, the entire column header needs to be enclosed in brackets, which means that double brackets are required in a column specifier. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[[Total $ Amount]] Here’s the list of special characters that need extra brackets in the formula: Tab Line feed Carriage return Comma (,) Colon (:) Period (.) Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign (#) Single quotation mark (\\') Double quotation mark (\") Left brace ({) Right brace (}) Dollar sign ($) Caret (^) Ampersand (&) Asterisk (*) Plus sign (+) Equal sign (=) Minus sign (-) Greater than symbol (>) Less than symbol (<) Division sign (/) At sign (@) Backslash (\\\\) Exclamation point (!) Left parenthesis (() Right parenthesis ()) Percent sign (%) Question mark (?) Backtick (`) Semicolon (;) Tilde (~) Underscore (_) Use an escape character for some special characters in column headers Some characters have special meaning and require the use of a single quotation mark (\\') as an escape character.

After a comma. Reference operators For more flexibility in specifying ranges of cells, you can use the following reference operators to combine column specifiers. This structured reference: Refers to: By using the: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All of the cells in two or more adjacent columns : (colon) range operator A2:B7 =DeptSales[Sales Amount],DeptSales[Commission Amount] A combination of two or more columns , (comma) union operator C2:C7, E2:E7 =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Sales Amount]] DeptSales[[Region]:[% Commission]] The intersection of two or more columns (space) intersection operator B2:C7 Special item specifiers To refer to specific portions of a table, such as just the totals row, you can use any of the following special item specifiers in your structured references. This special item specifier: Refers to: #All The entire table, including column headers, data, and totals (if any). #Data Just the data rows. #Headers Just the header row. #Totals Just the total row. If none exists, then it returns null. #This Row or @ or @[Column Name] Just the cells in the same row as the formula. These specifiers can’t be combined with any other special item specifiers. Use them to force implicit intersection behavior for the reference or to override implicit intersection behavior and refer to single values from a column. Excel automatically changes #This Row specifiers to the shorter @ specifier in tables that have more than one row of data. But if your table has only one row, Excel doesn’t replace the #This Row specifier, which may cause unexpected calculation results when you add more rows. To avoid calculation problems, make sure you enter multiple rows in your table before you enter any structured reference formulas. Qualifying structured references in calculated columns When you create a calculated column, you often use a structured reference to create the formula. This structured reference can be unqualified or fully qualified. For example, to create the calculated column, called Commission Amount, that calculates the amount of commission in dollars, you can use the following formulas:', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-structured-references-with-excel-tables-f5ed2452-2337-4f71-bed3-c8ae6d2b276e', 'ind': 4}, 'id': '69249612-39a5-4c70-bb0f-dafaa030a00f_5'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'Type of structured reference Example Comment Unqualified =[Sales Amount]*[% Commission] Multiplies the corresponding values from the current row. Fully qualified =DeptSales[Sales Amount]*DeptSales[% Commission] Multiples the corresponding values for each row for both columns. The general rule to follow is this: If you’re using structured references within a table, such as when you create a calculated column, you can use an unqualified structured reference, but if you use the structured reference outside of the table, you need to use a fully qualified structured reference. Examples of using structured references Here are some ways to use structured references. This structured reference: Refers to: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]] All the cells in the Sales Amount column. C1:C8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[% Commission]] The header of the % Commission column. D1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Region]] The total of the Region column. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. B8 =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]:[% Commission]] All the cells in Sales Amount and % Commission. C1:D8 =DeptSales[[#Data],[% Commission]:[Commission Amount]] Just the data of the % Commission and Commission Amount columns. D2:E7 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[Region]:[Commission Amount]] Just the headers of the columns between Region and Commission Amount. B1:E1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]:[Commission Amount]] The totals of the Sales Amount through Commission Amount columns. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. C8:E8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[#Data],[% Commission]] Just the header and the data of % Commission. D1:D7 =DeptSales[[#This Row], [Commission Amount]] or =DeptSales[@Commission Amount] The cell at the intersection of the current row and the Commission Amount column. If used in the same row as a header or total row, this will return a #VALUE! error. If you type the longer form of this structured reference (#This Row) in a table with multiple rows of data, Excel automatically replaces it with the shorter form (@). They both work the same. E5 (if the current row is 5) Strategies for working with structured references Consider the following when you work with structured references. Use Formula AutoComplete You may find that using Formula', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-structured-references-with-excel-tables-f5ed2452-2337-4f71-bed3-c8ae6d2b276e', 'ind': 5}, 'id': '69249612-39a5-4c70-bb0f-dafaa030a00f_6'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'AutoComplete is very useful when you enter structured references and to ensure the use of correct syntax. For more information, see Use Formula AutoComplete . Decide whether to generate structured references for tables in semi-selections By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi-selects the cells and automatically enters a structured reference instead of the cell range in the formula. This semi-selection behavior makes it much easier to enter a structured reference. You can turn this behavior on or off by selecting or clearing the Use table names in formulas check box in the File > Options > Formulas > Working with formulas dialog. Use workbooks with external links to Excel tables in other workbooks If a workbook contains an external link to an Excel table in another workbook, that linked source workbook must be open in Excel to avoid #REF! errors in the destination workbook that contains the links. If you open the destination workbook first and #REF! errors appear, they will be resolved if you then open the source workbook. If you open the source workbook first, you should see no error codes. Convert a range to a table and a table to a range When you convert a table to a range, all cell references change to their equivalent absolute A1 style references. When you convert a range to a table, Excel doesn’t automatically change any cell references of this range to their equivalent structured references. Turn off column headers You can toggle table column headers on and off from the table Design tab > Header Row . If you turn off table column headers, structured references that use column names aren’t affected, and you can still use them in formulas. Structured references that refer directly to the table headers (e.g. =DeptSales[[#Headers],[%Commission]] ) will result in #REF . Add or delete columns and rows to the table Because table data ranges often change, cell references for structured references adjust automatically. For example, if you use a table name in a formula to count all the data cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts. Rename a table or column If you rename a column or table, Excel automatically changes the use of that table and column header in all structured references that are used in the workbook. Move, copy, and fill structured references All structured references remain the same when you copy or move a formula that uses a structured reference. Note: Copying a structured reference and doing a fill of a structured reference are not the same', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-structured-references-with-excel-tables-f5ed2452-2337-4f71-bed3-c8ae6d2b276e', 'ind': 6}, 'id': '69249612-39a5-4c70-bb0f-dafaa030a00f_7'}\n",

Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less You can merge (combine) rows from one table into another simply by pasting the data in the first empty cells below the target table. The table will increase in size to include the new rows. If the rows in both tables match up, you can merge the columns of one table with another—by pasting them in the first empty cells to the right of the table. In this case also, the table will increase to accommodate the new columns. Merging rows is actually quite simple, but merging columns can be tricky if the rows of one table don\\'t correspond with the rows in the other table. By using VLOOKUP , you can avoid some of the alignment problems. Merge two tables using the VLOOKUP function In the example shown below, you\\'ll see two tables that previously had other names to new names: \"Blue\" and \"Orange.\" In the Blue table, each row is a line item for an order. So, Order ID 20050 has two items, Order ID 20051 has one item, Order ID 20052 has three items, and so on. We want to merge the Sales ID and Region columns with the Blue table, based on matching values in the Order ID columns of the Orange table. Order ID values repeat in the Blue table, but Order ID values in the Orange table are unique. If we were to simply copy-and-paste the data from the Orange table, the Sales ID and Region values for the second line item of order 20050 would be off by one row, which would change the values in the new columns in the Blue table. Here\\'s the data for the Blue table, which you can copy into a blank worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the Excel table Blue.

To do this, let\\'s paste the table headings Sales ID and Region into the cells to the right of the Blue table, and use VLOOKUP formulas to get the correct values from the Sales ID and Region columns of the Orange table. Here\\'s how: Copy the headings Sales ID and Region in the Orange table (only those two cells). Paste the headings into the cell, to the right of the Product ID heading of the Blue table. Now, the Blue table is five columns wide, including the new Sales ID and Region columns. In the Blue table, in the first cell beneath Sales ID, start writing this formula: =VLOOKUP( In the Blue table, pick the first cell in the Order ID column, 20050. The partially completed formula looks like this: The [@[Order ID]] part means \"get the value in this same row from the Order ID column.\" Type a comma, and select the entire Orange table with your mouse so that \"Orange[#All]\" is added to the formula. Type another comma, 2, another comma, and 0—like this: ,2,0 Press Enter, and the completed formula looks like this: The Orange[#All] part means \"look in all the cells in the Orange table.\" The 2 means \"get the value from the second column,\" and the 0 means \"return the value only if there\\'s an exact match.\" Notice that Excel filled the cells down in that column, using the VLOOKUP formula. Return to step 3, but this time start writing the same formula in the first cell beneath Region. In step 6, replace 2 with 3, so the completed formula looks like this: There\\'s just one difference between this formula and the first formula—the first gets values from column 2 of the Orange table, and the second gets them from column 3. Now you\\'ll see values in every cell of the new columns in the Blue table. They contain VLOOKUP formulas, but they\\'ll show the values. You\\'ll want to convert the VLOOKUP formulas in those cells to their actual values. Select all the value cells in the Sales ID column, and press Ctrl+C to copy them. Click Home > arrow below Paste . In the Paste gallery, click Paste Values . Select all the value cells in the Region column, copy them, and repeat steps 10 and 11.

Access Forms and reports Forms Forms Create a form that contains a subform (a one-to-many form) Create a form that contains a subform (a one-to-many form) Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less When you are working with relational data (related data that is stored in separate tables) in Access, you often need to view multiple tables or queries on the same form. For example, you might want to see customer data from one table and information about customer orders from another table at the same time. Subforms are a convenient tool for doing this, and Access provides several ways to help you create subforms quickly. What do you want to do? Learn about subforms Create or add a subform Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Open a subform in a new window in Design view Change the default view of a subform Add related data to a form without creating a subform Learn about subforms A subform is a form that is inserted in another form. The primary form is called the main form, and the form that is enclosed in form is called the subform. A form/subform combination is sometimes referred to as a hierarchical form, a master/detail form, or a parent/child form. Subforms are especially effective when you want to show data from tables or queries that have a one-to-many relationship. A one-to-many relationship is an association between two tables in which the primary key value of each record in the primary table corresponds to the value in the matching field or fields of many records in the related table. For example, you can create a form that displays employee data, and contains a subform that displays each employee\\'s orders. The data in the Employees table is the \"one\" side of the relationship. The data in the Orders table is the \"many\" side of the relationship — each employee can have more than one order. 1. The main form shows data from the \"one\" side of the relationship. 2. The subform shows data from the \"many\" side of the relationship. The main form and subform in this kind of form are linked so that the subform displays only records that are related to the current record in the main form. For example, when the main form displays Nancy Freehafer\\'s information, the subform displays only her orders. If the form and subform were unlinked, the subform would display all the orders, not just Nancy\\'s. The following table defines some of the terminology that is associated with subforms. Access will handle most of the details if you use the procedures in this article, but it is helpful to know what is occurring behind the scenes if you need to make modifications later. Term Definition Subform control The control that embeds a form into a form. You can think of the subform control as a \"view\" of another object in your database, whether it is another form, a table, or a query. The subform control provides properties which allow you to link the data displayed in the control to the data on the main form. Source Object property The property of the subform control that determines what object is displayed in the control. Datasheet A simple display of data in rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. The subform control displays a datasheet when its source object is a table or query, or when its source object is a form whose Default View property is set to Datasheet. In these cases, the subform is sometimes referred to as a datasheet or subdatasheet instead of as a subform. Link Child Fields property The property of the subform control that specifies which field or fields in the subform link the subform to the main form. Link Master Fields property The property of the subform control that specifies which field or fields on the main form link the main form to the subform. Notes: For best results, establish table relationships before following the procedures in this article. This enables Access to automatically create the links between subforms and main forms. To view, add, or modify relationships between the tables in your database, on the Database Tools tab, in the Relationships group, click Relationships . When a subform control has a form as its source object, it contains the fields that you place on the form, and it can be viewed as a single form, continuous form, or datasheet. One advantage of basing a subform on a form object is that you can add calculated fields to the subform, such as [Quantity] * [Unit price] . You can insert a datasheet or pivot view into a form by creating a subform control whose source object is a table or query. For more information, see the section Add related data to a form without creating a subform . Top of Page Create or add a subform Use the following table to determine which procedure is most appropriate for your situation. Scenario Recommended procedure You want Access to create both a main form and a subform, and to link the subform to the main form. Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard You want to use an existing form as the main form, but you want Access to create a new subform and add it to the main form. Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the Subform Wizard You want to use an existing form as the main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard This procedure creates a new form and subform combination by using the Form Wizard. This is also the quickest way to get started if you have not already created the forms that you want to use as the main form or the subform. On the Create tab, in the Forms group, click Form Wizard . On the first page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select a table or query. For this example, to create an Employees form that displays orders for each employee in a subform, we will select Table: Employees (the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Note: It does not matter which table or query you choose first. Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. On the same page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select another table or query from the list. For this example, we will select the Orders table (the \"many\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. When you click Next , assuming that you set up the relationships correctly before you started the wizard, the wizard asks How do you want to view your data? — that is, by which table or query. Select the table on the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship. For this example, to create the Employees form, we will click by Employees . The wizard displays a small diagram of a form. The page should resemble the following illustration: The box in the lower portion of the form diagram represents the subform. Note: If the wizard does not ask How do you want to view your data? , that means that Access did not detect a one-to-many relationship between the tables or queries that you selected. The wizard will continue, but Access will not add a subform to the form. You might want to click Cancel and examine your table relationships before you continue. At the bottom of the wizard page, select Form with subform(s) , and then click Next . On the What layout would you like for your subform? page, click the layout option that you want, and then click Next . Both layout styles arrange the subform data in rows and columns, but a tabular layout is more customizable. You can add color, graphics, and other formatting elements to a tabular subform, whereas a datasheet is more compact, like the datasheet view of a table. On the next page of the wizard, select a formatting style for the form, and then click Next . If you chose Tabular on the previous page, the formatting style you choose will also be applied to the subform. On the last page of the wizard, type the titles that you want for the forms. Access names the forms based on the titles that you type, and labels the subform based on the title that you type for the subform. Specify whether you want to open the form in Form view, so that you can view or enter information, or in Design view, so that you can modify its design, and then click Finish. Access creates two forms — one for the main form that contains the subform control, and one for the subform itself. Top of Page Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Use this procedure to add one or more subforms to an existing form. For each subform, you can choose to have Access create a new form or use an existing form as the subform. Right-click the existing form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the down-arrow to display the Controls gallery, and ensure that Use Control Wizards is selected. On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the Subform/Subreport button. Click on the form where you want to place the subform. Follow the directions in the wizard. When you click Finish , Access adds a subform control to your form. If you chose to have Access create a new form for the subform instead of using an existing form, Access creates the new form object and adds it to the Navigation Pane. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Use this procedure if you want to use an existing form as a main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the form that you want to use as the main form, and then click Layout View . Drag the form that you want to use as the subform from the Navigation Pane onto the main form. Access adds a subform control to the main form and binds the control to the form that you dragged from the Navigation Pane. Access also tries to link the subform to the main form, based on the relationships that have been defined in your database. Repeat this step to add any additional subforms to the main form. To verify that the linking was successful, on the Home tab, in the Views group, click View , click Form View , and then use the main form\\'s record selector to advance through several records. If the subform filters itself correctly for each employee, then the procedure is complete. If the previous test does not work, Access was unable to determine how to link the subform to the main form, and the Link Child Fields and Link Master Fields properties of the subform control are blank. You must set these properties manually by doing the following: Right-click the main form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . Click the subform control one time to select it. If the Property Sheet task pane is not displayed, press F4 to display it. In the Property Sheet, click the Data tab. Click the Build button next to the Link Child Fields property box. The Subform Field Linker dialog box appears. In the Master Fields and Child Fields drop-down lists, select the fields that you want to link the forms with, and then click OK . If you are not sure which fields to use, click Suggest to have Access try to determine the linking fields. Tip: If you do not see the field that you want to use to link the forms, you might need to edit the record source of the master form or child form to help make sure that the linking field is in it. For example, if the form is based on a query, you should make sure that the linking field is present in the query results. Save the main form, switch to Form view, and then verify that the form works as expected. Open a subform in a new window in Design view If you want to make design changes to a subform while you are working on its main form in Design view, you can open the subform in its own window: Click the subform to select it. On the Form Design tab, in the Tools group, click Subform in New Window . Top of Page Change the default view of a subform When you add a subform to a form, the subform/subreport control displays the subform according to the subform’s Default View property. This property can be set to the following values: Single Form Continuous Forms Datasheet Split Form When you first create a subform, this property may be set to Continuous Forms or perhaps Single Form . However, if you set the Default View property of a subform to Datasheet , then the subform will display as a datasheet on the main form. To set the Default View property of a subform: Close any open objects. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the subform and then click Design View . If the Property Sheet is not already displayed, press F4 to display it. In the drop-down list at the top of the Property Sheet, make sure Form is selected. On the Format tab of the Property Sheet, set the Default View property to the view you want to use. Note: If the view you want to use is not in the list, make sure the “Allow…View” property for the view is set to Yes . For example, if you want to specify Datasheet as the default view for the form, make sure that the Allow Datasheet View property is set to Yes . Save and close the subform, and then open the main form to check the results. Top of Page Add related data to a form without creating a subform It is not always necessary to create a separate form object to display related data. For example, if you are working on a form in Layout view or Design view and you drag a table or query from the Navigation Pane to the form, Access creates a subform/subreport control that displays the data in that object. The object’s Default View property determines how the data is displayed. Usually, this is set to Datasheet view, but you can also set the Default View property of a table or query to Single Form , Split Form , or Continuous Forms , giving you more flexibility in displaying related data on forms. Note: Changing the Default View property for a table or query determines how it is displayed whenever it is opened, whether you open it from the Navigation Pane or view it in a subform/subreport control. Because changing the view settings for a table can sometimes cause confusion when opening the table from the Navigation Pane, we recommend using a query for this procedure instead of a table.

Save and close the subform, and then open the main form to check the results. Top of Page Add related data to a form without creating a subform It is not always necessary to create a separate form object to display related data. For example, if you are working on a form in Layout view or Design view and you drag a table or query from the Navigation Pane to the form, Access creates a subform/subreport control that displays the data in that object. The object’s Default View property determines how the data is displayed. Usually, this is set to Datasheet view, but you can also set the Default View property of a table or query to Single Form , Split Form , or Continuous Forms , giving you more flexibility in displaying related data on forms. Note: Changing the Default View property for a table or query determines how it is displayed whenever it is opened, whether you open it from the Navigation Pane or view it in a subform/subreport control. Because changing the view settings for a table can sometimes cause confusion when opening the table from the Navigation Pane, we recommend using a query for this procedure instead of a table.

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 3}, 'id': '152aece9-2e2b-4b78-9402-bd53848347be_4'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 4}, 'id': '152aece9-2e2b-4b78-9402-bd53848347be_5'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': \"on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Related topics Formulas & functions XLOOKUP Excel Help & Training Formulas & functions Formulas & functions XLOOKUP Overview of formulas in Excel Article XLOOKUP Article VLOOKUP Article SUM function Article COUNTIF function Article IF function Article IFS Article SUMIF Article SUMIFS Article MATCH Article Next: Common uses of functions XLOOKUP function Use the XLOOKUP function to find things in a table or range by row. For example, look up the price of an automotive part by the part number, or find an employee name based on their employee ID. With XLOOKUP, you can look in one column for a search term and return a result from the same row in another column, regardless of which side the return column is on. Note: XLOOKUP is not available in Excel 2016 and Excel 2019, however, you may come across a situation of using a workbook in Excel 2016 or Excel 2019 with the XLOOKUP function in it created by someone else using a newer version of Excel. Syntax The XLOOKUP function searches a range or an array, and then returns the item corresponding to the first match it finds. If no match exists, then XLOOKUP can return the closest (approximate) match. =XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]) Argument Description lookup_value Required* The value to search for *If omitted, XLOOKUP returns blank cells it finds in lookup_array . lookup_array Required The array or range to search return_array Required The array or range to return [if_not_found] Optional Where a valid match is not found, return the [if_not_found] text you supply. If a valid match is not found, and [if_not_found] is missing, #N/A is returned. [match_mode] Optional Specify the match type: 0 - Exact match. If none found, return #N/A. This is the default. -1 - Exact match. If none found, return the next smaller item. 1 - Exact match. If none found, return the next larger item. 2 - A wildcard match where *, ?, and ~ have special meaning . [search_mode] Optional Specify the search mode to use: 1 - Perform a search starting at the first item. This is the default. -1 - Perform a reverse search starting at the last item. 2 - Perform a binary search that relies on lookup_array being sorted in ascending order. If not sorted, invalid results will be returned. -2 - Perform a binary search that relies on lookup_array being sorted in descending order. If not sorted, invalid results will be returned. Examples Example 1 uses XLOOKUP to look up a country name in a range, and then return its telephone country code. It includes the lookup_value (cell F2), lookup_array (range B2:B11), and return_array (range D2:D11) arguments. It doesn't include the match_mode argument, as XLOOKUP produces an exact match by default. Note: XLOOKUP uses a lookup array and a return array, whereas VLOOKUP uses a single table array followed by a column index number. The equivalent VLOOKUP formula in this case would be: =VLOOKUP(F2,B2:D11,3,FALSE) ——————————————————————————— Example 2 looks up employee information based on an employee ID number. Unlike VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP can return an array with multiple items, so a single formula can return both employee name and department from cells C5:D14. ——————————————————————————— Example 3 adds an if_not_found argument to the preceding example. ——————————————————————————— Example 4 looks in column C for the personal income entered in cell E2, and finds a matching tax rate in column B. It sets the if_not_found argument to return 0 (zero) if nothing is found. The match_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will look for an exact match, and if it can't find one, it returns the next larger item. Finally, the search_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will search from the first item to the last. Note: XARRAY's lookup_array column is to the right of the return_array column, whereas VLOOKUP can only look from left-to-right. ——————————————————————————— Example 5 uses a nested XLOOKUP function to perform both a vertical and horizontal match. It first looks for Gross Profit in column B, then looks for Qtr1 in the top row of the table (range C5:F5), and finally returns the value at the intersection of the two. This is similar to using the INDEX and MATCH functions together. Tip: You can also use XLOOKUP to replace the HLOOKUP function. Note: The formula in cells D3:F3 is: =XLOOKUP(D2,$B6:$B17,XLOOKUP($C3,$C5:$G5,$C6:$G17)) . ——————————————————————————— Example 6 uses the SUM function , and two nested XLOOKUP functions, to sum all the values between two ranges. In this case, we want to sum the values for grapes, bananas, and include pears, which are between the two. The formula in cell E3 is: =SUM(XLOOKUP(B3,B6:B10,E6:E10):XLOOKUP(C3,B6:B10,E6:E10)) How does it work? XLOOKUP returns a range, so when it calculates, the formula ends up looking like this: =SUM($E$7:$E$9) . You can see how this works on your own by selecting a cell with an XLOOKUP formula similar to this one, then select Formulas > Formula Auditing > Evaluate Formula , and then select Evaluate to step through the calculation.

Introduction to What-If Analysis Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel 2021 Excel 2021 for Mac Excel 2019 Excel 2019 for Mac Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less By using What-If Analysis tools in Excel, you can use several different sets of values in one or more formulas to explore all the various results. For example, you can do What-If Analysis to build two budgets that each assumes a certain level of revenue. Or, you can specify a result that you want a formula to produce, and then determine what sets of values will produce that result. Excel provides several different tools to help you perform the type of analysis that fits your needs. Note that this is just an overview of those tools. There are links to help topics for each one specifically. Overview What-If Analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. Three kinds of What-If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios , Goal Seek , and Data Tables . Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine possible results. A Data Table works with only one or two variables, but it can accept many different values for those variables. A Scenario can have multiple variables, but it can only accommodate up to 32 values. Goal Seek works differently from Scenarios and Data Tables in that it takes a result and determines possible input values that produce that result. In addition to these three tools, you can install add-ins that help you perform What-If Analysis, such as the Solver add-in. The Solver add-in is similar to Goal Seek, but it can accommodate more variables. You can also create forecasts by using the fill handle and various commands that are built into Excel. For more advanced models, you can use the Analysis ToolPak add-in . Use scenarios to consider many different variables A Scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on a worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values on a worksheet and then switch to any of these new scenarios to view different results. For example, suppose you have two budget scenarios: a worst case and a best case. You can use the Scenario Manager to create both scenarios on the same worksheet, and then switch between them. For each scenario, you specify the cells that change and the values to use for that scenario. When you switch between scenarios, the result cell changes to reflect the different changing cell values. 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell If several people have specific information in separate workbooks that you want to use in scenarios, you can collect those workbooks and merge their scenarios. After you have created or gathered all the scenarios that you need, you can create a Scenario Summary Report that incorporates information from those scenarios. A scenario report displays all the scenario information in one table on a new worksheet. Note: Scenario reports are not automatically recalculated. If you change the values of a scenario, those changes will not show up in an existing summary report. Instead, you must create a new summary report. Use Goal Seek to find out how to get a desired result If you know the result that you want from a formula, but you're not sure what input value the formula requires to get that result, you can use the Goal Seek feature. For example, suppose that you need to borrow some money. You know how much money you want, how long a period you want in which to pay off the loan, and how much you can afford to pay each month. You can use Goal Seek to determine what interest rate you must secure in order to meet your loan goal. Cells B1, B2, and B3 are the values for the loan amount, term length, and interest rate. Cell B4 displays the result of the formula =PMT(B3/12,B2,B1) . Note: Goal Seek works with only one variable input value. If you want to determine more than one input value, for example, the loan amount and the monthly payment amount for a loan, you should instead use the Solver add-in. For more information about the Solver add-in, see the section Prepare forecasts and advanced business models , and follow the links in the See Also section. Use Data Tables to see the effects of one or two variables on a formula If you have a formula that uses one or two variables, or multiple formulas that all use one common variable, you can use a Data Table to see all the outcomes in one place. Using Data Tables makes it easy to examine a range of possibilities at a glance. Because you focus on only one or two variables, results are easy to read and share in tabular form. If automatic recalculation is enabled for the workbook, the data in Data Tables immediately recalculates; as a result, you always have fresh data. Cell B3 contains the input value. Cells C3, C4, and C5 are values Excel substitutes based on the value entered in B3. A Data Table cannot accommodate more than two variables. If you want to analyze more than two variables, you can use Scenarios. Although it is limited to only one or two variables, a Data Table can use as many different variable values as you want. A Scenario can have a maximum of 32 different values, but you can create as many scenarios as you want. Prepare forecasts and advanced business models If you want to prepare forecasts, you can use Excel to automatically generate future values that are based on existing data, or to automatically generate extrapolated values that are based on linear trend or growth trend calculations. You can fill in a series of values that fit a simple linear trend or an exponential growth trend by using the fill handle or the Series command. To extend complex and nonlinear data, you can use worksheet functions or the regression analysis tool in the Analysis ToolPak Add-in. Although Goal Seek can accommodate only one variable, you can project backward for more variables by using the Solver add-in . By using Solver, you can find an optimal value for a formula in one cell—called the target cell—on a worksheet. Solver works with a group of cells that are related to the formula in the target cell. Solver adjusts the values in the changing cells that you specify—called the adjustable cells—to produce the result that you specify from the target cell formula. You can apply constraints to restrict the values that Solver can use in the model, and the constraints can refer to other cells that affect the target cell formula. Need more help?

Less By using What-If Analysis tools in Excel, you can use several different sets of values in one or more formulas to explore all the various results. For example, you can do What-If Analysis to build two budgets that each assumes a certain level of revenue. Or, you can specify a result that you want a formula to produce, and then determine what sets of values will produce that result. Excel provides several different tools to help you perform the type of analysis that fits your needs. Note that this is just an overview of those tools. There are links to help topics for each one specifically. Overview What-If Analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. Three kinds of What-If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios , Goal Seek , and Data Tables . Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine possible results. A Data Table works with', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4', 'ind': 0}, 'id': '17debae7-a8f6-4500-80ea-f1aab0a343d4_1'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': \"only one or two variables, but it can accept many different values for those variables. A Scenario can have multiple variables, but it can only accommodate up to 32 values. Goal Seek works differently from Scenarios and Data Tables in that it takes a result and determines possible input values that produce that result. In addition to these three tools, you can install add-ins that help you perform What-If Analysis, such as the Solver add-in. The Solver add-in is similar to Goal Seek, but it can accommodate more variables. You can also create forecasts by using the fill handle and various commands that are built into Excel. For more advanced models, you can use the Analysis ToolPak add-in . Use scenarios to consider many different variables A Scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on a worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values on a worksheet and then switch to any of these new scenarios to view different results. For example, suppose you have two budget scenarios: a worst case and a best case. You can use the Scenario Manager to create both scenarios on the same worksheet, and then switch between them. For each scenario, you specify the cells that change and the values to use for that scenario. When you switch between scenarios, the result cell changes to reflect the different changing cell values. 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell If several people have specific information in separate workbooks that you want to use in scenarios, you can collect those workbooks and merge their scenarios. After you have created or gathered all the scenarios that you need, you can create a Scenario Summary Report that incorporates information from those scenarios. A scenario report displays all the scenario information in one table on a new worksheet. Note: Scenario reports are not automatically recalculated. If you change the values of a scenario, those changes will not show up in an existing summary report. Instead, you must create a new summary report. Use Goal Seek to find out how to get a desired result If you know the result that you want from a formula, but you're not sure what input value the formula requires to get that result, you can use the Goal Seek feature. For example, suppose that you need to borrow some money. You know how much money you want, how long a period you want in which to pay off the loan, and how much you can afford to pay each month. You can use Goal\", 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/introduction-to-what-if-analysis-22bffa5f-e891-4acc-bf7a-e4645c446fb4', 'ind': 1}, 'id': '17debae7-a8f6-4500-80ea-f1aab0a343d4_2'}\n",

Cells B1, B2, and B3 are the values for the loan amount, term length, and interest rate. Cell B4 displays the result of the formula =PMT(B3/12,B2,B1) . Note: Goal Seek works with only one variable input value. If you want to determine more than one input value, for example, the loan amount and the monthly payment amount for a loan, you should instead use the Solver add-in. For more information about the Solver add-in, see the section Prepare forecasts and advanced business models , and follow the links in the See Also section. Use Data Tables to see the effects of one or two variables on a formula If you have a formula that uses one or two variables, or multiple formulas that all use one common variable, you can use a Data Table to see all the outcomes in one place. Using Data Tables makes it easy to examine a range of possibilities at a glance. Because you focus on only one or two variables, results are easy to read and share in tabular form. If automatic recalculation is enabled for the workbook, the data in Data Tables immediately recalculates; as a result, you always have fresh data. Cell B3 contains the input value. Cells C3, C4, and C5 are values Excel substitutes based on the value entered in B3. A Data Table cannot accommodate more than two variables.

Less In PivotTables, you can use summary functions in value fields to combine values from the underlying source data. If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The PivotTable would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. Another way to calculate is to use Measures in Power Pivot, which you create using a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula. For more information, see Create a Measure in Power Pivot . About calculations Windows, Mac Web iPad \\ue70d PivotTables provide ways to calculate data. Learn about the calculation methods that are available, how calculations are affected by the type of source data, and how to use formulas in PivotTables and PivotCharts. Available calculation methods To calculate values in a PivotTable, you can use any or all of the following types of calculation methods: Summary functions in value fields The data in the values area summarize the underlying source data in the PivotTable. For example, the following source data: Produces the following PivotTables and PivotCharts. If you create a PivotChart from the data in a PivotTable, the values in that PivotChart reflect the calculations in the associated PivotTable report. In the PivotTable, the Month column field provides the items March and April . The Region row field provides the items North , South , East , and West . The value at the intersection of the April column and the North row is the total sales revenue from the records in the source data that have Month values of April and Region values of North . In a PivotChart, the Region field might be a category field that shows North , South , East , and West as categories. The Month field could be a series field that shows the items March , April , and May as series represented in the legend. A Values field named Sum of Sales could contain data markers that represent the total revenue in each region for each month. For example, one data marker would represent, by its position on the vertical (value) axis, the total sales for April in the North region. To calculate the value fields, the following summary functions are available for all types of source data except Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) source data. Function Summarizes Sum The sum of the values. This is the default function for numeric data. Count The number of data values. The Count summary function works the same as the COUNTA function . Count is the default function for data other than numbers. Average The average of the values. Max The largest value. Min The smallest value. Product The product of the values. Count Nums The number of data values that are numbers. The Count Nums summary function works the same as the COUNT function . StDev An estimate of the standard deviation of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StDevp The standard deviation of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Var An estimate of the variance of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Varp The variance of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Custom calculations A custom calculation shows values based on other items or cells in the data area. For example, you could display values in the Sum of Sales data field as a percentage of March sales, or as a running total of the items in the Month field. The following functions are available for custom calculations in value fields. Function Result No Calculation Displays the value that is entered in the field. % of Grand Total Displays values as a percentage of the grand total of all of the values or data points in the report. % of Column Total Displays all of the values in each column or series as a percentage of the total for the column or series. % of Row Total Displays the value in each row or category as a percentage of the total for the row or category. % Of Displays values as a percentage of the value of the Base item in the Base field . % of Parent Row Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item on rows) % of Parent Column Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item on columns) % of Parent Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item of the selected Base field ) Difference From Displays values as the difference from the value of the Base item in the Base field . % Difference From Displays values as the percentage difference from the value of the Base item in the Base field . Running Total in Displays the value for successive items in the Base field as a running total. % Running Total in Calculates the value for successive items in the Base field that are displayed as a running total as a percentage. Rank Smallest to Largest Displays the rank of selected values in a specific field, listing the smallest item in the field as 1, and each larger value will have a higher rank value. Rank Largest to Smallest Displays the rank of selected values in a specific field, listing the largest item in the field as 1, and each smaller value will have a higher rank value. Index Calculates values as follows: ((value in cell) x (Grand Total of Grand Totals)) / ((Grand Row Total) x (Grand Column Total)) Formulas If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The report would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. How the type of source data affects calculations Calculations and options that are available in a report depend on whether the source data came from an OLAP database or a non-OLAP data source. Calculations based on OLAP source data For PivotTables that are created from OLAP cubes, the summarized values are precalculated on the OLAP server before Excel displays the results. You cannot change how these precalculated values are calculated in the PivotTable. For example, you cannot change the summary function that is used to calculate data fields or subtotals, or add calculated fields or calculated items. Also, if the OLAP server provides calculated fields, known as calculated members, you will see these fields in the PivotTable Field List. You will also see any calculated fields and calculated items that are created by macros that were written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and stored in your workbook, but you won't be able to change these fields or items. If you need additional types of calculations, contact your OLAP database administrator. For OLAP source data, you can include or exclude the values for hidden items when calculating subtotals and grand totals. Calculations based on non-OLAP source data In PivotTables that are based on other types of external data or on worksheet data, Excel uses the Sum summary function to calculate value fields that contain numeric data, and the Count summary function to calculate data fields that contain text. You can choose a different summary function, such as, Average, Max, or Min, to further analyze and customize your data. You can also create your own formulas that use elements of the report or other worksheet data by creating a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Using formulas in PivotTables You can create formulas only in reports that are based on a non-OLAP source data. You cannot use formulas in reports that are based on an OLAP database. When you use formulas in PivotTables, you should know about the following formula syntax rules and formula behavior: PivotTable formula elements In formulas that you create for calculated fields and calculated items, you can use operators and expressions as you do in other worksheet formulas. You can use constants and refer to data from the report, but you cannot use cell references or defined names. You cannot use worksheet functions that require cell references or defined names as arguments, and you cannot use array functions. Field and item names Excel uses field and item names to identify those elements of a report in your formulas. In the following example, the data in range C3:C9 is using the field name Dairy . A calculated item in the Type field that estimates sales for a new product based on Dairy sales could use a formula such as =Dairy * 115% . Note: In a PivotChart, the field names are displayed in the PivotTable field list, and item names can be seen in each field drop-down list. Don't confuse these names with those you see in chart tips, which reflect series and data point names instead. Formulas operate on sum totals, not individual records Formulas for calculated fields operate on the sum of the underlying data for any fields in the formula. For example, the calculated field formula =Sales * 1.2 multiplies the sum of the sales for each type and region by 1.2; it does not multiply each individual sale by 1.2 and then sum the multiplied amounts. Formulas for calculated items operate on the individual records. For example, the calculated item formula =Dairy *115% multiplies each individual sale of Dairy times 115%, after which the multiplied amounts are summarized together in the Values area. Spaces, numbers, and symbols in names In a name that includes more than one field, the fields can be in any order. In the example above, cells C6:D6 can be 'April North' or 'North April' . Use single quotation marks around names that are more than one word or that include numbers or symbols. Totals Formulas cannot refer to totals (such as, March Total , April Total , and Grand Total in the example). Field names in item references You can include the field name in a reference to an item. The item name must be in square brackets — for example, Region[North] . Use this format to avoid #NAME? errors when two items in two different fields in a report have the same name. For example, if a report has an item named Meat in the Type field and another item named Meat in the Category field, you can prevent #NAME? errors by referring to the items as Type[Meat] and Category[Meat] . Referring to items by position You can refer to an item by its position in the report as currently sorted and displayed. Type[1] is Dairy , and Type[2] is Seafood . The item referred to in this way can change whenever the positions of items change or different items are displayed or hidden. Hidden items are not counted in this index. You can use relative positions to refer to items. The positions are determined relative to the calculated item that contains the formula. If South is the current region, Region[-1] is North ; if North is the current region, Region[+1] is South . For example, a calculated item could use the formula =Region[-1] * 3% . If the position that you give is before the first item or after the last item in the field, the formula results in a #REF! error. Using formulas in PivotCharts To use formulas in a PivotChart, you create the formulas in the associated PivotTable, where you can see the individual values that make up your data, and then you can view the results graphically in the PivotChart. For example, the following PivotChart shows sales for each salesperson per region: To see what sales would look like if they were increased by 10 percent, you could create a calculated field in the associated PivotTable that uses a formula such as =Sales * 110% . The result immediately appears in the PivotChart, as shown in the following chart: To see a separate data marker for sales in the North region minus a transportation cost of 8 percent, you could create a calculated item in the Region field with a formula such as =North – (North * 8%) . The resulting chart would look like this: However, a calculated item that is created in the Salesperson field would appear as a series represented in the legend and appear in the chart as a data point in each category. Create formulas in a PivotTable Important: You cannot create formulas in a PivotTable that is connected to an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data source. Before you start, decide whether you want a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Use a calculated field when you want to use the data from another field in your formula. Use a calculated item when you want your formula to use data from one or more specific items within a field. For calculated items, you can enter different formulas cell by cell. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCounty has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation. Add a calculated field Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, type a name for the field. In the Formula box, enter the formula for the field. To use the data from another field in the formula, click the field in the Fields box, and then click Insert Field . For example, to calculate a 15% commission on each value in the Sales field, you could enter = Sales * 15% . Click Add . Add a calculated item to a field Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. If items in the field are grouped, on the Analyze tab, in the Group group, click Ungroup . Click the field where you want to add the calculated item. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Item . In the Name box, type a name for the calculated item. In the Formula box, enter the formula for the item. To use the data from an item in the formula, click the item in the Items list, and then click Insert Item (the item must be from the same field as the calculated item). Click Add . Enter different formulas cell by cell for calculated items Click a cell for which you want to change the formula. To change the formula for several cells, hold down CTRL and click the additional cells. In the formula bar, type the changes to the formula. Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Solve Order . Click a formula, and then click Move Up or Move Down . Continue until the formulas are in the order that you want them to be calculated. View all formulas that are used in a PivotTable You can display a list of all the formulas that are used in the current PivotTable. Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . Edit a PivotTable formula Before you edit a formula, determine whether that formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. If the formula is in a calculated item, also determine whether the formula is the only one for the calculated item. For calculated items, you can edit individual formulas for specific cells of a calculated item. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCalc has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. Determine whether a formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . In the list of formulas, find the formula that you want to change listed under Calculated Field or Calculated Item. When there are multiple formulas for a calculated item, the default formula that was entered when the item was created has the calculated item name in column B. For additional formulas for a calculated item, column B contains both the calculated item name and the names of intersecting items. For example, you might have a default formula for a calculated item named MyItem , and another formula for this item identified as MyItem January Sales . In the PivotTable, you would find this formula in the Sales cell for the MyItem row and January column. Continue by using one of the following editing methods. Edit a calculated field formula Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, select the calculated field for which you want to change the formula. In the Formula box, edit the formula. Click Modify . Edit a single formula for a calculated item Click the field that contains the calculated item. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Item . In the Name box, select the calculated item. In the Formula box, edit the formula. Click Modify . Edit an individual formula for a specific cell of a calculated item Click a cell for which you want to change the formula. To change the formula for several cells, hold down CTRL and click the additional cells. In the formula bar, type the changes to the formula. Tip: If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation. For more information, see Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas . Delete a PivotTable formula Note: Deleting a PivotTable formula removes it permanently. If you do not want to remove a formula permanently, you can hide the field or item instead by dragging it out of the PivotTable. Determine whether the formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. Calculated fields appear in the PivotTable Field List. Calculated items appear as items within other fields. Do one of the following: To delete a calculated field, click anywhere in the PivotTable. To delete a calculated item, in the PivotTable, click the field that contains the item that you want to delete. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field or Calculated Item . In the Name box, select the field or item that you want to delete. Click Delete . To summarize values in a PivotTable in Excel for the web, you can use summary functions like Sum, Count, and Average.

In the following example, the\", 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/calculate-values-in-a-pivottable-11f41417-da80-435c-a5c6-b0185e59da77', 'ind': 3}, 'id': '9e7b732d-9f7f-4910-8825-f49f5d551f80_4'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': \"data in range C3:C9 is using the field name Dairy . A calculated item in the Type field that estimates sales for a new product based on Dairy sales could use a formula such as =Dairy * 115% . Note: In a PivotChart, the field names are displayed in the PivotTable field list, and item names can be seen in each field drop-down list. Don't confuse these names with those you see in chart tips, which reflect series and data point names instead. Formulas operate on sum totals, not individual records Formulas for calculated fields operate on the sum of the underlying data for any fields in the formula. For example, the calculated field formula =Sales * 1.2 multiplies the sum of the sales for each type and region by 1.2; it does not multiply each individual sale by 1.2 and then sum the multiplied amounts. Formulas for calculated items operate on the individual records. For example, the calculated item formula =Dairy *115% multiplies each individual sale of Dairy times 115%, after which the multiplied amounts are summarized together in the Values area. Spaces, numbers, and symbols in names In a name that includes more than one field, the fields can be in any order. In the example above, cells C6:D6 can be 'April North' or 'North April' . Use single quotation marks around names that are more than one word or that include numbers or symbols. Totals Formulas cannot refer to totals (such as, March Total , April Total , and Grand Total in the example). Field names in item references You can include the field name in a reference to an item. The item name must be in square brackets — for example, Region[North] . Use this format to avoid #NAME? errors when two items in two different fields in a report have the same name. For example, if a report has an item named Meat in the Type field and another item named Meat in the Category field, you can prevent #NAME? errors by referring to the items as Type[Meat] and Category[Meat] . Referring to items by position You can refer to an item by its position in the report as currently sorted and displayed. Type[1] is Dairy , and Type[2] is Seafood . The item referred to in this way can change whenever the positions of items change or different items are displayed or hidden. Hidden items are not counted in this\", 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/calculate-values-in-a-pivottable-11f41417-da80-435c-a5c6-b0185e59da77', 'ind': 4}, 'id': '9e7b732d-9f7f-4910-8825-f49f5d551f80_5'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'index. You can use relative positions to refer to items. The positions are determined relative to the calculated item that contains the formula. If South is the current region, Region[-1] is North ; if North is the current region, Region[+1] is South . For example, a calculated item could use the formula =Region[-1] * 3% . If the position that you give is before the first item or after the last item in the field, the formula results in a #REF! error. Using formulas in PivotCharts To use formulas in a PivotChart, you create the formulas in the associated PivotTable, where you can see the individual values that make up your data, and then you can view the results graphically in the PivotChart. For example, the following PivotChart shows sales for each salesperson per region: To see what sales would look like if they were increased by 10 percent, you could create a calculated field in the associated PivotTable that uses a formula such as =Sales * 110% . The result immediately appears in the PivotChart, as shown in the following chart: To see a separate data marker for sales in the North region minus a transportation cost of 8 percent, you could create a calculated item in the Region field with a formula such as =North – (North * 8%) . The resulting chart would look like this: However, a calculated item that is created in the Salesperson field would appear as a series represented in the legend and appear in the chart as a data point in each category. Create formulas in a PivotTable Important: You cannot create formulas in a PivotTable that is connected to an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data source. Before you start, decide whether you want a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Use a calculated field when you want to use the data from another field in your formula. Use a calculated item when you want your formula to use data from one or more specific items within a field. For calculated items, you can enter different formulas cell by cell. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCounty has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August.

Less Sometimes you may want to review records from one Access table only if there are corresponding records in another Access table that contain one or more fields with matching data. For example, you may want to review the employee records of employees who have processed at least one order to determine which employees are eligible for a bonus. Or, you may want to review contact information for customers who live in the same city as an employee so that you can match employees with a customers for in-person meetings. When you want to compare two Access tables and find matching data, you can either: Create a query that joins fields from each table where those fields contain corresponding information, either by using an existing relationship or by using a join that you create for the purpose of the query. This method provides optimum performance (the speed with which the query returns results), but you cannot join fields that have dissimilar data types. Create a query that compares fields by using one field as a criterion for the other. Using a field as a criterion for another field is generally slower than using joins, because joins eliminate rows from a query's results before the underlying tables are read, whereas criteria are applied to a query's results after the underlying tables are read. However, you can use a field as a field criterion to compare fields that have dissimilar data types, which you cannot do by using joins. This article discusses how to compare two tables to identify matching data, and provides sample data that you can use with example procedures. What do you want to do? Compare two tables by using joins Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Compare two tables by using joins To compare two tables by using joins, you create a select query that includes both tables. If there is not already an existing relationship between the tables on the fields that contain the corresponding data, you create a join on the fields that you want to examine for matches. You can create as many joins as you want, but each pair of joined fields must be of the same or compatible data type. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a table that stores student major data and a table that stores class enrollment data. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors since the recent curriculum changes, you need to review records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. Prepare sample data In this example, you build a query that determines how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected math students' grades. You use the following two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments. Add these two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments, to a database. Access provides several ways to add these sample tables to a database. You can enter the data manually, you can copy each table into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Office Excel 2007), and then import the worksheets into Access, or you can paste the data into a text editor, such as Notepad, and then import the data from the resulting text files. The steps in this section explain how to enter data manually in a blank datasheet, and also explain how to copy the sample tables to Excel, and then import those tables into Access.

Enter the sample data manually Open a new or existing database. On the Create tab, in the Tables group, click Table . Access adds a new, blank table to your database. Note: You do not need to follow this step if you open a new, blank database, but you will need to follow it whenever you need to add a table to the database. Double-click the first cell in the header row, and then type the name of the field in the sample table. By default, Access denotes blank fields in the header row with the text Add New Field , such as: Use the arrow keys to move to the next blank header cell, and then type the second field name. (You can also double-click the new cell.) Repeat this step for each field name. Enter the data in the sample table. As you enter the data, Access infers a data type for each field. Each field has a specific data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time. Setting data types helps ensure accurate data entry and also helps prevent mistakes, such as using a telephone number in a calculation. For these sample tables, allow Access to infer the data type, but be sure to review the data type that Access infers for each field. After you finish entering the data, click Save , or press CTRL+S. The Save As dialog box appears. In the Table Name box, type the name of the sample table, and then click OK . You use the name of each sample table (for example, Student Majors) because the queries in the procedure sections of this article also use those names. After you finish entering the sample data, you are ready to compare the two tables . Skip the following section (Create the sample worksheets), unless you want to learn how to create a worksheet that is based on the sample data from the tables in the preceding section. Create the sample worksheets Start your spreadsheet program, and create a new, blank file. If you use Excel, a new, blank workbook is created by default when you start the program. Copy the first sample table from the preceding section and paste it into the first worksheet, starting at the first cell. Be sure that you copy the header row, because it contains the field names of the sample table. Using the technique provided by your spreadsheet program, give the worksheet the same name as the sample table. For example, when you paste the Class Enrollments sample data, name the worksheet Class Enrollments. Repeat steps 2 and 3, copying the second sample table to a blank worksheet and renaming the worksheet. Note: You may need to add worksheets to your spreadsheet file. For information about adding worksheets to your spreadsheet file, see the help for your spreadsheet program. Save the workbook to a convenient location on your computer or your network, and go to the next set of steps. Create database tables from the worksheets In a new or existing database: On the External Data tab, in the Import group, click Excel . -or- Click More , and then select a spreadsheet program from the list. The Get External Data - Program Name Spreadsheet dialog box appears. Click Browse , locate and open the spreadsheet file that you created in the previous steps, and then click OK . The Import Spreadsheet Wizard starts. By default, the wizard selects the first worksheet in the workbook (Student Majors, if you followed the steps in the previous section), and data from that worksheet appears in the lower section of the wizard page. Click Next . On the next page of the wizard, select the First Row Contains Column Headings check box, and then click Next . On the next page, you can use the text boxes and lists under Field Options to change field names and data types, or to omit fields from the import operation. For this example, you do not need to change anything. Click Next . On the next page, select the No primary key option, and then click Next . By default, Access applies the name of the worksheet to your new table. Accept the name in the Import to Table box, and then click Finish . On the Save Import Steps page, click Close to complete the wizard. Repeat steps 1 through 7 until you have created a table from each worksheet in the spreadsheet file. Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using joins Now you are ready to compare the Class Enrollments table and the Student Majors table. Because you have not defined relationships between the two tables, you need to create joins between the appropriate fields in the query. The tables have more than one field in common, and you will need to create a join for each pair of common fields: Student ID, Year, and Curriculum (Class Enrollments table) and Major (Student Majors table). In this example, you are only interested in math majors, so you will also use a field criterion to limit the query results. Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. On the Create tab, click Query Design . Double-click the table that contains the records that you want to display — in this example, the Class Enrollments table, and then double-click the table to which you are comparing it — in this example, the Student Majors table. Drag the Student ID field from the Class Enrollments table to the Student ID field of the Student Majors table. A line appears between the two tables in the design grid, indicating that you have created a join. Double-click the line to open the Join Properties dialog box. Review the three options in the Join Properties dialog box. By default, option 1 is selected. In some cases, you need to adjust the join properties to include extra rows from one table. Because you are trying to find only matching data, leave the join set to option 1. Close the Join Properties dialog box by clicking Cancel . You will need to create two other joins. Create these joins by dragging the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then by dragging the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field on the Student Majors table. In the Class Enrollments table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) to add all of the table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column in the query design grid. In the Criteria row of the Major column, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Sometimes you may want to compare tables on the basis of fields that have matching data, but have different data types. For example, a field in one table may have a Number data type, and you want to compare that field to a field in another table that has a Text data type. Fields that contain similar data yet have different field types can result when numbers are stored as text, either by design, or for other reasons, such as importing data from another program. Because you cannot create joins between fields that have different data types, you will need to use a different method to compare the fields. You can compare two fields that have different data types by using one field as a criterion for the other. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a Student Majors table and a Class Enrollments table. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors, you need to look at records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. However, one of the fields that you want to use to compare the tables has a different data type from its counterpart. To compare two tables by using a field as a criterion, you create a select query that includes both tables. You include the fields that you want to display, and you also include the field that corresponds to the field that you want to use as a criterion. You then create a criterion to compare the tables. You can create as many criteria to compare fields as you want. To illustrate this method, you will use the sample tables from the previous section , but you will change the data type of the Student ID field of the sample Student Majors table from Number to Text. Because you cannot create a join between two fields that have different data types, you will have to compare the two Student ID fields by using one field as a criterion for the other.

Double-click Class Enrollments , and then double-click Student Majors . Drag the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then drag the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field of the Student Majors table. Because these fields have the same data types, you can compare them by using joins. Joins are the preferred method for comparing fields that have the same data type. Double-click the asterisk ( * ) on the Class Enrollments table to add all of that table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Student ID field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Student ID column of the design grid. In the Criteria row of the Student ID column, type Like [Class Enrollments].[Student ID] .

Less This article explains how to create and run an append query. You use an append query when you need to add new records to an existing table by using data from other sources. If you need to change data in an existing set of records, such as updating the value of a field, you can use an update query. If you need to make a new table from a selection of data, or to merge two tables into one new table, you can use a make-table query. For more information about update queries or make-table queries, or for general information about other ways to add records to a database or change existing data, see the See Also section. In this article Overview Create and run an append query Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query Overview An append query selects records from one or more data sources and copies the selected records to an existing table. For example, suppose that you acquire a database that contains a table of potential new customers, and that you already have a table in your existing database that stores that kind of data. You\\'d like to store the data in one place, so you decide to copy it from the new database into your existing table. To avoid entering the new data manually, you can use an append query to copy the records. Benefits of using an append query By using a query to copy data, you can: Append multiple records in one pass If you copy data manually, you usually have to perform multiple copy/paste operations. By using a query, you select all the data at once, and then copy it. Review your selection before you copy it You can view your selection in Datasheet view and can make adjustments to your selection as needed before you copy the data. This can be particularly handy if your query includes criteria or expressions, and you need several tries to get it just right. You cannot undo an append query. If you make a mistake, you must either restore your database from a backup or correct your error, either manually or by using a delete query. Use criteria to refine your selection For example, you might want to only append records of customers who live in your city. Append records when some of the fields in the data sources don\\'t exist in the destination table For example, suppose that your existing customer table has eleven fields, and the new table that you want to copy from only has nine of those eleven fields. You can use an append query to copy the data from the nine fields that match and leave the other two fields blank. Basic steps of an append query The process of creating an append query follows these basic steps: Create a select query You start by selecting the data that you want to copy. You can adjust your select query as needed, and run it as many times as you want to make sure you are selecting the data that you want to copy. Convert the select query to an append query After your selection is ready, you change the query type to Append . Choose the destination fields for each column in the append query In some cases, Access automatically chooses the destination fields for you. You can adjust the destination fields, or choose them if Access did not. Preview and run the query to append the records Before you append the records, you can switch to Datasheet view for a preview of the appended records. Important: You cannot undo an append query. Consider backing up your database or the destination table. Create and run an append query In this section Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query Step 3: Choose the destination fields Step 4: Preview and run the append query Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Open the database that contains the records that you want to copy. On the Create tab, in the Queries group, click Query Design . Double-click the tables or queries that contain the records that you want to copy, and then click Close . The tables or queries appear as one or more windows in the query designer. Each window lists the fields in a table or query. This figure shows a typical table in the query designer. 1. Assets table shown in the query designer 2. Query design grid Double-click each field that you want to append. The selected fields appear in the Field row in the query design grid. The data types of the fields in the source table must be compatible with the data types of the fields in the destination table. Text fields are compatible with most other types of fields. Number fields are only compatible with other number fields. For example, you can append numbers to a text field, but you cannot append text into a number field. You can also use an expression as a field — such as =Date() to automatically return today\\'s date — and you can use expressions with table or query fields in the design grid to customize the data that you select. For example, if your destination table has a field that stores a four-digit year and the source table has a regular date/time field, you might use the DatePart function with the source field to select only the year. To quickly add all the fields in a table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) at the top of the list of table fields. This figure shows the design grid with all fields added. Optionally, you can enter one or more criteria in the Criteria row of the design grid. The following table shows some example criteria and explains the effect they have on a query. Criteria Effect > 234 Returns all numbers greater than 234. To find all numbers less than 234, use < 234. >= \"Callahan\" Returns all records from Callahan through the end of the alphabet. Between #2/2/2017# And #12/1/2017# Returns dates from 2-Feb-17 through 1-Dec-17 (ANSI-89). If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard characters, use single quotation marks (\\') instead of pound signs. Example: Between \\'2/2/2017\\' And \\'12/1/2017\\'. Not \"Germany\" Finds all records where the exact contents of the field are not exactly equal to \"Germany.\" The criterion will return records that contain characters in addition to \"Germany,\" such as \"Germany (euro)\" or \"Europe (Germany)\". Not \"T*\" Finds all records except those beginning with T. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign ( % ) instead of the asterisk ( * ). Not \"*t\" Finds all records that do not end with t. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. In(Canada,UK) In a list, finds all records containing Canada or UK. Like \"[A-D]*\" In a Text field, finds all records that start with the letters A through D. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. Like \"*ar*\" Finds all records that include the letter sequence \"ar\". If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. Like \"Maison Dewe?\" Finds all records that begin with \"Maison\" and that also contain a 5-letter second string in which the first 4 letters are \"Dewe\" and the last letter is unknown (indicated by a question mark). If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the underscore ( _ ) instead of the question mark. #2/2/2017# Finds all records for February 2, 2017. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, surround the date with single quotation marks instead of pound signs ( # ). Example: \\'2/2/2017\\'. < Date() - 30 Returns all dates more than 30 days old. Date() Returns all records containing today\\'s date. Between Date() And DateAdd(\"M\", 3, Date()) Returns all records between today\\'s date and three months from today\\'s date. Is Null Returns all records that contain a null (blank or undefined) value. Is Not Null Returns all records that contain a value. \"\" Returns all records that contain a zero-length string. You use zero-length strings when you need to add a value to a required field, but you don\\'t yet know what that value is. For example, a field may require a fax number, but some of your customers may not have fax machines. In that case, you enter a pair of double quotation marks with no space between them (\"\") instead of a number. On the Query Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . Verify that the query returned the records that you want to copy. If you need to add or remove fields from the query, switch back to Design view and add fields as described in the preceding step, or select the fields that you don\\'t want and press DELETE to remove them from the query. Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query On the Home tab, in the View group, click View , and then click Design View . On the Query Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Append . The Append dialog box appears. Next, you specify whether to append records to a table in the current database, or to a table in a different database. Do one of the following: In the Append dialog box, click Current Database , select the destination table from the Table Name combo box, and then click OK . -or- In the Append dialog box, click Another Database . In the File Name box, enter the location and name of the destination database. In the Table Name combo box, enter the name of the destination table, and then click OK . Step 3: Choose the destination fields The way that you choose destination fields depends on how you created your select query in Step 1. If you... Access... Added all the fields from your source table or query Adds all the fields in the destination table to the Append to row in the design grid Added individual fields to the query or used expressions, and the field names in the source and destination tables match Automatically adds the matching destination fields to the Append to row in the query Added individual fields or used expressions, and any of the names in the source and destination tables don\\'t match Adds the matching fields, and leaves unmatched fields blank If Access leaves fields blank, you can click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. This figure illustrates how you click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. Note: If you leave the destination field blank, the query will not append data to that field. Step 4: Preview and run the append query To preview your changes, switch to Datasheet view. Tip: To quickly switch views, right-click the tab at the top of the query, and then click the view that you want. Return to Design view, and then click Run to append the records. Note: While running a query that returns a large amount of data you might get an error message indicating that you will not be able to undo the query. Try increasing the limit on the memory segment to 3MB to allow the query to go through. Top of Page Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query If you try to run an append query and it seems like nothing happens, check the Access status bar for the following message: This action or event has been blocked by Disabled Mode. To fix this, click Enable Content in the Message Bar to enable the query. Note: When you enable the append query, you also enable all other database content. If you don\\'t see the Message Bar, it may be hidden. You can show it, unless it has also been disabled. If the Message Bar has been disabled, you can enable it.

If you need to change data in an existing set of records, such as updating the value of a field, you can use an update query. If you need to make a new table from a selection of data, or to merge two tables into one new table, you can use a make-table query. For more information about update queries or make-table queries, or for general information about other ways to add records to a database or change existing data, see the See Also section.

Subtotal row and column fields In a PivotTable, select an item of a row or column field. Make sure it is a field and not a value. On the PivotTable Analyze tab, in the Active Field group, click Field Settings . This displays the Field Settings dialog box. In the Field Settings dialog box, under Subtotals , do one of the following: To subtotal an outer row or column label using the default summary function, click Automatic . To remove subtotals, click None . Note: If a field contains a calculated item, you can\\'t change the subtotal summary function. To use a different function, to display more than one type of subtotal, or to subtotal an inner row or column label, click Custom (if this option is available), and then select a function. Functions that you can use as a subtotal Function Description Sum The sum of the values. This is the default function for numeric data. Count The number of data values. The Count summary function works the same as the COUNTA function . Count is the default function for data other than numbers. Average The average of the values. Max The largest value. Min The smallest value. Product The product of the values. Count Numbers The number of data values that are numbers. The Count Numbers summary function works the same as the worksheet COUNT function . StDev An estimate of the standard deviation of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StDevp The standard deviation of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Var An estimate of the variance of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Varp The variance of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized.

Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less The Relationships window lets you define relationship between items stored in multiple Access tables. It is available by clicking Database Tools > Relationships . Relationships are like the rules that govern how data is connected in your database. In a well-normalized order-processing database, for example, most likely you’ll have customer information in one table and order information in another table. You want to make sure customers don’t get separated from their orders, right? And you don’t want an order to be created that doesn’t have a valid customer connected to it. The Relationships window is where you go to set these rules so that they apply throughout your database. If you’ve built an Access query before, you’ll notice that the Relationships window looks a lot like the top part of the Query Builder: In the Relationships window, you use the commands on the Design tab to add tables to the view, and then you drag fields between tables to set up the relationships. In this example, the relationship allows for multiple orders to be connected to each customer, but it keeps you from creating an order for a customer that doesn’t exist. Once you set up these rules in the Relationships window, they’ll apply to the whole database (for example, if you create a new query, the joins will automatically be set up according to your relationship rules). Note: Deleting a table from the Relationships window won’t delete it from your database, nor will it remove relationships that you’ve already established.

For example, you may want to find names with errors, confirm the value and reference of a name, view or edit descriptive comments, or determine the scope. You can also sort and filter the list of names, and easily add, change, or delete names from one location. To open the Name Manager dialog box, on the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Name Manager . The Name Manager dialog box displays the following information about each name in a list box: Column Name Description Name One of the following: A defined name, which is indicated by a defined name icon. A table name, which is indicated by a table name icon. Note: A table name is the name for an Excel table, which is a collection of data about a particular subject stored in records (rows) and fields (columns). Excel creates a default Excel table name of Table1, Table2, and so on, each time you insert an Excel table. You can change a table\\'s name to make it more meaningful. For more information about Excel tables, see Using structured references with Excel tables . Value The current value of the name, such as the results of a formula, a string constant, a cell range, an error, an array of values, or a placeholder if the formula cannot be evaluated. The following are representative examples: \"this is my string constant\" 3.1459 {2003;12,2002;23,;2001,18} #REF! {...} Refers To The current reference for the name. The following are representative examples: =Sheet1!$A$3 =8.3 =HR!$A$1:$Z$345 =SUM(Sheet1!A1,Sheet2!B2) Scope A worksheet name, if the scope is the local worksheet level. \"Workbook,\" if the scope is the global workbook level. This is the default option. Comment Additional information about the name up to 255 characters. The following are representative examples: This value will expire on May 2, 2007. Don\\'t delete! Critical name! Based on the ISO certification exam numbers. Refers to: The reference for the selected name. You can quickly edit the range of a name by modifying the details in the Refers to box. After making the change you can click Commit to save changes, or click Cancel to discard your changes. Notes: You cannot use the Name Manager dialog box while you are changing the contents of a cell. The Name Manager dialog box does not display names defined in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), or hidden names (the Visible property of the name is set to False). Create a named range On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Define Name . In the New Name dialog box, in the Name box, type the name you want to use for your reference. Note: Names can be up to 255 characters in length. The scope automatically defaults to Workbook . To change the name’s scope, in the Scope drop-down list box, select the name of a worksheet. Optionally, in the Comment box, enter a descriptive comment up to 255 characters. In the Refers to box, do one of the following: Click Collapse Dialog (which temporarily shrinks the dialog box), select the cells on the worksheet, and then click Expand Dialog . To enter a constant, type = (equal sign) and then type the constant value. To enter a formula, type = and then type the formula. Tips: Be careful about using absolute or relative references in your formula. If you create the reference by clicking on the cell you want to refer to, Excel will create an absolute reference, such as \"Sheet1!$B$1\". If you type a reference, such as \"B1\", it is a relative reference. If your active cell is A1 when you define the name, then the reference to \"B1\" really means \"the cell in the next column\". If you use the defined name in a formula in a cell, the reference will be to the cell in the next column relative to where you enter the formula. For example, if you enter the formula in C10, the reference would be D10, and not B1.

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 0}, 'id': '0d7647e4-a14f-4c0b-b3a9-0d22475ef5a1_1'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 1}, 'id': '0d7647e4-a14f-4c0b-b3a9-0d22475ef5a1_2'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 2}, 'id': '0d7647e4-a14f-4c0b-b3a9-0d22475ef5a1_3'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 3}, 'id': '0d7647e4-a14f-4c0b-b3a9-0d22475ef5a1_4'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': 'and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/relationships-between-tables-in-a-data-model-533dc2b6-9288-4363-9538-8ea6e469112b', 'ind': 4}, 'id': '0d7647e4-a14f-4c0b-b3a9-0d22475ef5a1_5'}\n",
      "New Item: {'document': \"on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Access Tables Creating tables Creating tables Introduction to tables Introduction to tables Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less Tables are essential objects in a database because they hold all the information or data. For example, a database for a business can have a Contacts table that stores the names of their suppliers, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. Because other database objects depend so heavily on tables, you should always start your design of a database by creating all of its tables and then creating any other objects. Before you create tables in Access, consider your requirements and determine all the tables that you might need. For an introduction to planning and designing a database, see Database design basics . In this article Overview Table and field properties Data Types Table relationships Keys Benefits of using relationships Overview A relational database like Access usually has several related tables. In a well-designed database, each table stores data about a particular subject, such as employees or products. A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers, dates, and hyperlinks. A record: Contains specific data, like information about a particular employee or', \"a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com . Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. You must set a field's data type when you create the field. You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon. Examples of automatic data type detection The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view. If you enter: Access creates a field with a data type of: John Short Text http://www.contoso.com You can use any valid Internet protocol prefix. For example, http://, https://, and mailto: are valid prefixes. Hyperlink 1 Number, Long Integer 50,000 Number, Long Integer 50,000.99 Number, Double 50000.389 Number, Double 12/67 The date and time formats\", 'recognized are those of your user locale. Date/Time December 31, 2016 Date/Time 10:50:23 Date/Time 10:50 am Date/Time 17:50 Date/Time $12.50 The currency symbol recognized is that of your user locale. Currency 21.75 Number, Double 123.00% Number, Double 3.46E+03 Number, Double Top of Page Table relationships Although each table stores data about a different subject, tables in an Access database usually store data about subjects that are related to each other. For example, a database might contain: A customers table that lists your company’s customers and their addresses. A products table that lists the products that you sell, including prices and pictures for each item. An orders table that tracks customer orders. Because you store data about different subjects in separate tables, you need some way to tie the data together so that you can easily combine related data from those separate tables. To connect the data stored in different tables, you create relationships. A relationship is a logical connection between two tables that specifies fields that the tables have in common. For more information, see Guide to table relationships . Top of Page Keys Fields that are part of a table relationship are called keys. A key usually consists of one field, but may consist of more than one field. There are two kinds of keys: Primary key A table can have only one primary key. A primary key consists of one or more fields that uniquely identify each record that you store in the table. Often, there is a unique identification number, such as an ID number, a serial number, or a code, that serves as a primary key. For example, you might have a Customers table where each customer has a unique customer ID number. The customer ID field is the primary key of the Customers table. When a primary key contains more than one field, it is usually composed of pre-existing fields that, taken together, provide unique values. For example, you might use a combination of last name, first name, and birth date as the primary key for a table about people. For more information, see adding or changing a table’s primary key . Foreign key A table can also have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key contains values that correspond to values in the primary key of another table. For example, you might have an Orders table in which each order has a customer ID number that corresponds to a record in a Customers', \"table. The customer ID field is a foreign key of the Orders table. The correspondence of values between key fields forms the basis of a table relationship. You use a table relationship to combine data from related tables. For example, suppose that you have a Customers table and an Orders table. In your Customers table, each record is identified by the primary key field, ID. To associate each order with a customer, you add a foreign key field to the Orders table that corresponds to the ID field of the Customers table, and then create a relationship between the two keys. When you add a record to the Orders table, you use a value for customer ID that comes from the Customers table. Whenever you want to view any information about an order's customer, you use the relationship to identify which data from the Customers table corresponds to which records in the Orders table. 1. A primary key, identified by the key icon next to the field name. 2. A foreign key — note the absence of the key icon. Do not add a field if you expect that each unique entity represented in the table might require more than value for the field. Continuing the preceding example, if you want to start tracking orders placed by your customers, you do not add a field to the table, because each customer will have more than one order. Instead, you create a new table to store orders, and then create a relationship between the two tables. Top of Page Benefits of using relationships Keeping data separated in related tables produces the following benefits: Consistency Because each item of data is recorded only once, in one table, there is less opportunity for ambiguity or inconsistency. For example, you store a customer's name only once, in a table about customers, rather than storing it repeatedly (and potentially inconsistently) in a table that contains order data. Efficiency Recording data in only one place means you use less disk space. Moreover, smaller tables tend to provide data more quickly than larger tables. Finally, if you don't use separate tables for separate subjects, you will introduce null values (the absence of data) and redundancy into your tables, both of which can waste space and impede performance. Comprehensibility The design of a database is easier to understand if the subjects are properly separated into tables. Plan your tables with relationships in mind. You can use the Lookup Wizard to create a foreign key field if the table that contains the corresponding primary key already exists. The Lookup Wizard creates the relationship for you.

The power of a relational database lies in combining data across tables. To do that, you first need to establish relationships between your tables. Then, put Access to work to combine data in queries, forms, and reports. To see all existing relationships defined for a database, open an Access template, go to the Database Tools tab, and select Relationships . Note: If you open a blank database or haven’t defined any table relationships, Access prompts you to add a table or query. Before you can add a relationship, you need at least two tables. Ideally, you build all of your tables first. To learn more, see Create relationships with the Lookup Wizard and Create relationships with', 'the Relationships Pane . Understanding the Relationships view The lines in the Relationships view indicate connections between the tables. In the following image, the table on the left is the parent table. The table on the right is the child table. The line between them connects the fields (in this case, Order ID and Product ID) used to match data. Lines and symbols show you how your tables are related: A thick connecting line means you’re enforcing referential data integrity. That’s good. It keeps your data synced. In our illustration, the number 1 indicates that there can be only one matching record in that table. In the Orders table shown here, only one record matches each order. The ∞ symbol indicates that many records can include the same ID. In the Order Details table shown here, an order (indicated by its order ID) may appear more than once, because the same order may include multiple products. Types of relationships between tables There are three types of relationships between tables: One-to-one . When each item in each table only appears once. For example, each employee can have only one company car to use. For more information, see Create one-to-one relationships . One-to-many . When one item in one table can have a relationship to multiple items in another table. For example, each purchase order can include multiple products. Many-to-many . When one or more items in one table can have a relationship to one or more items in another table. For example, each order can have multiple products, and each product can appear on many orders. To find out more, see Create many-to-many relationships . One-to-many relationships One of the most common relationships between tables in well-designed databases is the one-to-many relationship. Relationships between tables normally rely on the primary key in one of the tables. Recall that the primary key is a unique identifier (often numeric) for each record. To show that the information in two different tables is related, you usually create a relationship using the primary key from one of the tables. In the relationship shown here, for example, each person in the Contacts table has an ID, which is the primary key (indicated by the key symbol next to it). That ID also appears in the Owner field in the Assets table. To email the person associated with an asset, get the value from the Email Address field. To do so, look for the value in the Owner field of the Asset table and then search for that ID in the Contacts table.', 'The number 1 at one end of the connecting line and the ∞ symbol at the other end indicate that this is a one-to-many relationship, so one contact might be associated with many assets. Edit a relationship If you are modifying an existing database or if you created your database from a template, you can edit the existing relationships to meet your needs. Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . On the Design tab, select Edit Relationships . Table/Query is the parent table on the left (in this example, Customers). Related Table/Query is the child table (in this example, Orders). Even if the tables don’t appear in this order in the Relationships view, their placement in the dialog box indicates the direction of the line connecting them and the relationship. That’s important if, for example, it’s a one-to-many relationship, because it indicates that the table on the left is the one (the parent table) and the table on the right is the many (the child table). To change the fields that connect the tables, select a different field below each table shown. In this example, the ID field in the Customers table connects to the Customer ID field in the Orders table. Change the way Access synchronizes your data between tables. Enforce Referential Integrity To prevent invalid data and to keep references in sync across table relationships, select this. For example, suppose you have a one-to-one relationship between the Employees and Employee Benefits tables. If an employee leaves the company and you remove them from your Employees table, the related employee record in the Employee Benefits table is removed, too. Sometimes enforcing referential integrity doesn’t make sense. For example, suppose you have a one-to-many relationship between Shippers and Orders. You delete a shipper, and that shipper maps to orders in the Orders table. Those orders become orphans, meaning that they still contain a Shipper ID, but the ID is no longer valid because the record that it references no longer exists. Cascade Update Related Fields To make sure that data in related fields is updated in all the related tables, select this. For example, suppose you simply want to change the ID of a shipper. Setting', \"this option ensures that the Shipper ID is updated—not just in the Shipper table but also in any other tables connected to it that also include that Shipper ID, such as the Orders table. Cascade Delete Related Records The decision to select this depends on whether you need to retain records in some tables even though they might be deleted from other tables. For example, suppose you delete a shipper. If this option is selected, Access deletes all records in all tables that reference that Shipper ID, including all orders (in the Orders table) shipped by that shipper. You only select this option if you are sure you want your order history deleted. To change the relationship between the tables from an inner join to an outer join, select the Join Type button. For more information, see Create queries with outer joins . Delete a table relationship Note: If the tables you want to work with are in use, you must first close them, along with any open objects that use them. To remove a table relationship: Select Database Tools > Relationships . Select the line connecting the two related tables. Tip: If you don’t see the relationship you want, on the Design tab, in the Relationships group, select All Relationships . Select the Delete key. If you’re prompted to verify that you want to delete the relationship, select Yes . Note: When you remove a relationship, you also remove referential integrity support for that relationship, if any. As a result, Access will no longer prevent changes that result in orphan records on the many side of a one-to-many relationship. Want more? Create, edit or delete a relationship Need more help?

Using structured references with Excel tables Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel 2021 Excel 2021 for Mac Excel 2019 Excel 2019 for Mac Excel 2016 Excel 2013 Excel Mobile More... Less When you create an Excel table , Excel assigns a name to the table, and to each column header in the table. When you add formulas to an Excel table, those names can appear automatically as you enter the formula and select the cell references in the table instead of manually entering them. Here's an example of what Excel does: Instead of using explicit cell references Excel uses table and column names =Sum(C2:C7) =SUM(DeptSales[Sales Amount]) That combination of table and column names is called a structured reference. The names in structured references adjust whenever you add or remove data from the table. Structured references also appear when you create a formula outside of an Excel table that references table data. The references can make it easier to locate tables in a large workbook. To include structured references in your formula, click the table cells you want to reference instead of typing their cell reference in the formula. Let’s use the following example\", 'data to enter a formula that automatically uses structured references to calculate the amount of a sales commission. Sales Person Region Sales Amount % Commission Commission Amount Joe North 260 10% Robert South 660 15% Michelle East 940 15% Erich West 410 12% Dafna North 800 15% Rob South 900 15% Copy the sample data in the table above, including the column headings, and paste it into cell A1 of a new Excel worksheet. To create the table, select any cell within the data range, and press Ctrl+T . Make sure the My table has headers box is checked, and click OK . In cell E2, type an equal sign ( = ), and click cell C2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[Sales Amount]] appears after the equal sign. Type an asterisk ( * ) directly after the closing bracket, and click cell D2. In the formula bar, the structured reference [@[% Commission]] appears after the asterisk. Press Enter . Excel automatically creates a calculated column and copies the formula down the entire column for you, adjusting it for each row. What happens when I use explicit cell references? If you enter explicit cell references in a calculated column, it can be harder to see what the formula is calculating. In your sample worksheet, click cell E2 In the formula bar, enter =C2*D2 and press Enter . Notice that while Excel copies your formula down the column, it doesn\\'t use structured references. If, for example, you add a column between the existing columns C and D, you\\'d have to revise your formula. How do I change a table name? When you create an Excel table, Excel creates a default table name (Table1, Table2, and so on), but you can change the table name to make it more meaningful. Select any cell in the table to show the Table Tools > Design tab on the ribbon. Type the name you want in the Table Name box, and press Enter . In our example data, we used the name DeptSales . Use the following rules for table names: Use valid characters Always start a name with a letter, an underscore character ( _ ), or a backslash ( \\\\ ). Use letters, numbers, periods, and underscore characters for the rest of the name. You can’t use \"C\", \"c\", \"R\", or \"r\" for the name, because they’re already designated as a', 'shortcut for selecting the column or row for the active cell when you enter them in the Name or Go To box. Don’t use cell references Names can’t be the same as a cell reference, such as Z$100 or R1C1. Don’t use a space to separate words Spaces can’t be used in the name. You can use the underscore character ( _ ) and period ( . ) as word separators. For example, DeptSales, Sales_Tax or First.Quarter. Use no more than 255 characters A table name can have up to 255 characters. Use unique table names Duplicate names aren’t allowed. Excel doesn’t distinguish between upper and lowercase characters in names so if you enter “Sales” but already have another name called “SALES\" in the same workbook, you’ll be prompted to choose a unique name. Use an object identifier If you plan on having a mix of tables, PivotTables and charts, it\\'s a good idea to prefix your names with the object type. For example: tbl_Sales for a sales table, pt_Sales for a sales PivotTable, and chrt_Sales for a sales chart, or ptchrt_Sales for a sales PivotChart. This keeps all of your names in an ordered list in the Name Manager . Structured reference syntax rules You can also enter or change structured references manually in the formula but to do that, it will help to understand structured reference syntax. Let’s go over the following formula example: =SUM(DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]],DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]]) This formula has the following structured reference components: Table name: DeptSales is a custom table name. It references the table data, without any header or total rows. You can use a default table name, such as Table1, or change it to use a custom name. Column specifier: [Sales Amount] and [Commission Amount ] are column specifiers that use the names of the columns they represent. They reference the column data, without any column header or total row. Always enclose specifiers in brackets as shown. Item specifier: [#Totals] and [#Data] are special item specifiers that refer to specific portions of the table, such as the total row. Table specifier: [[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and [[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are table specifiers that represent the outer portions of the structured reference. Outer references follow the table name, and you', 'enclose them in square brackets. Structured reference: (DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]] and DeptSales[[#Data],[Commission Amount]] are structured references, represented by a string that begins with the table name and ends with the column specifier. To create or edit structured references manually, use these syntax rules: Use brackets around specifiers All table, column, and special item specifiers need to be enclosed in matching brackets ([ ]). A specifier that contains other specifiers requires outer matching brackets to enclose the inner matching brackets of the other specifiers. For example: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All column headers are text strings But they don’t require quotes when they’re used in a structured reference. Numbers or dates, such as 2014 or 1/1/2014, are also considered text strings. You can’t use expressions with column headers. For example, the expression DeptSalesFYSummary[[2014]:[2012]] won’t work. Use brackets around column headers with special characters If there are special characters, the entire column header needs to be enclosed in brackets, which means that double brackets are required in a column specifier. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[[Total $ Amount]] Here’s the list of special characters that need extra brackets in the formula: Tab Line feed Carriage return Comma (,) Colon (:) Period (.) Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign (#) Single quotation mark (\\') Double quotation mark (\") Left brace ({) Right brace (}) Dollar sign ($) Caret (^) Ampersand (&) Asterisk (*) Plus sign (+) Equal sign (=) Minus sign (-) Greater than symbol (>) Less than symbol (<) Division sign (/) At sign (@) Backslash (\\\\) Exclamation point (!) Left parenthesis (() Right parenthesis ()) Percent sign (%) Question mark (?) Backtick (`) Semicolon (;) Tilde (~) Underscore (_) Use an escape character for some special characters in column headers Some characters have special meaning and require the use of a single quotation mark (\\') as an escape character. For example: =DeptSalesFYSummary[\\'#OfItems] Here’s the list of special characters that need an escape character (\\') in the formula: Left bracket ([) Right bracket (]) Pound sign(#) Single quotation mark (\\') At sign (@) Use the space character to improve readability in a structured reference You can use space characters to improve the readability', 'of a structured reference. For example: =DeptSales[ [Sales Person]:[Region] ] or =DeptSales[[#Headers], [#Data], [% Commission]] It’s recommended to use one space: After the first left bracket ([) Preceding the last right bracket (]). After a comma. Reference operators For more flexibility in specifying ranges of cells, you can use the following reference operators to combine column specifiers. This structured reference: Refers to: By using the: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Region]] All of the cells in two or more adjacent columns : (colon) range operator A2:B7 =DeptSales[Sales Amount],DeptSales[Commission Amount] A combination of two or more columns , (comma) union operator C2:C7, E2:E7 =DeptSales[[Sales Person]:[Sales Amount]] DeptSales[[Region]:[% Commission]] The intersection of two or more columns (space) intersection operator B2:C7 Special item specifiers To refer to specific portions of a table, such as just the totals row, you can use any of the following special item specifiers in your structured references. This special item specifier: Refers to: #All The entire table, including column headers, data, and totals (if any). #Data Just the data rows. #Headers Just the header row. #Totals Just the total row. If none exists, then it returns null. #This Row or @ or @[Column Name] Just the cells in the same row as the formula. These specifiers can’t be combined with any other special item specifiers. Use them to force implicit intersection behavior for the reference or to override implicit intersection behavior and refer to single values from a column. Excel automatically changes #This Row specifiers to the shorter @ specifier in tables that have more than one row of data. But if your table has only one row, Excel doesn’t replace the #This Row specifier, which may cause unexpected calculation results when you add more rows. To avoid calculation problems, make sure you enter multiple rows in your table before you enter any structured reference formulas. Qualifying structured references in calculated columns When you create a calculated column, you often use a structured reference to create the formula. This structured reference can be unqualified or fully qualified. For example, to create the calculated column, called Commission Amount, that calculates the amount of commission in dollars, you can use the following formulas:', 'Type of structured reference Example Comment Unqualified =[Sales Amount]*[% Commission] Multiplies the corresponding values from the current row. Fully qualified =DeptSales[Sales Amount]*DeptSales[% Commission] Multiples the corresponding values for each row for both columns. The general rule to follow is this: If you’re using structured references within a table, such as when you create a calculated column, you can use an unqualified structured reference, but if you use the structured reference outside of the table, you need to use a fully qualified structured reference. Examples of using structured references Here are some ways to use structured references. This structured reference: Refers to: Which is cell range: =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]] All the cells in the Sales Amount column. C1:C8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[% Commission]] The header of the % Commission column. D1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Region]] The total of the Region column. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. B8 =DeptSales[[#All],[Sales Amount]:[% Commission]] All the cells in Sales Amount and % Commission. C1:D8 =DeptSales[[#Data],[% Commission]:[Commission Amount]] Just the data of the % Commission and Commission Amount columns. D2:E7 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[Region]:[Commission Amount]] Just the headers of the columns between Region and Commission Amount. B1:E1 =DeptSales[[#Totals],[Sales Amount]:[Commission Amount]] The totals of the Sales Amount through Commission Amount columns. If there is no Totals row, then it returns null. C8:E8 =DeptSales[[#Headers],[#Data],[% Commission]] Just the header and the data of % Commission. D1:D7 =DeptSales[[#This Row], [Commission Amount]] or =DeptSales[@Commission Amount] The cell at the intersection of the current row and the Commission Amount column. If used in the same row as a header or total row, this will return a #VALUE! error. If you type the longer form of this structured reference (#This Row) in a table with multiple rows of data, Excel automatically replaces it with the shorter form (@). They both work the same. E5 (if the current row is 5) Strategies for working with structured references Consider the following when you work with structured references. Use Formula AutoComplete You may find that using Formula', 'AutoComplete is very useful when you enter structured references and to ensure the use of correct syntax. For more information, see Use Formula AutoComplete . Decide whether to generate structured references for tables in semi-selections By default, when you create a formula, clicking a cell range within a table semi-selects the cells and automatically enters a structured reference instead of the cell range in the formula. This semi-selection behavior makes it much easier to enter a structured reference. You can turn this behavior on or off by selecting or clearing the Use table names in formulas check box in the File > Options > Formulas > Working with formulas dialog. Use workbooks with external links to Excel tables in other workbooks If a workbook contains an external link to an Excel table in another workbook, that linked source workbook must be open in Excel to avoid #REF! errors in the destination workbook that contains the links. If you open the destination workbook first and #REF! errors appear, they will be resolved if you then open the source workbook. If you open the source workbook first, you should see no error codes. Convert a range to a table and a table to a range When you convert a table to a range, all cell references change to their equivalent absolute A1 style references. When you convert a range to a table, Excel doesn’t automatically change any cell references of this range to their equivalent structured references. Turn off column headers You can toggle table column headers on and off from the table Design tab > Header Row . If you turn off table column headers, structured references that use column names aren’t affected, and you can still use them in formulas. Structured references that refer directly to the table headers (e.g. =DeptSales[[#Headers],[%Commission]] ) will result in #REF . Add or delete columns and rows to the table Because table data ranges often change, cell references for structured references adjust automatically. For example, if you use a table name in a formula to count all the data cells in a table, and you then add a row of data, the cell reference automatically adjusts. Rename a table or column If you rename a column or table, Excel automatically changes the use of that table and column header in all structured references that are used in the workbook. Move, copy, and fill structured references All structured references remain the same when you copy or move a formula that uses a structured reference. Note: Copying a structured reference and doing a fill of a structured reference are not the same', \"thing. When you copy, all the structured references remain the same, while when you fill a formula, fully qualified structured references adjust the column specifiers like a series as summarized in the following table. If the fill direction is: And while filling, you press: Then: Up or down Nothing There is no column specifier adjustment. Up or down Ctrl Column specifiers adjust like a series. Right or left None Column specifiers adjust like a series. Up, down, right, or left Shift Instead of overwriting values in current cells, current cell values are moved and column specifiers are inserted. Need more help?

Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less You can merge (combine) rows from one table into another simply by pasting the data in the first empty cells below the target table. The table will increase in size to include the new rows. If the rows in both tables match up, you can merge the columns of one table with another—by pasting them in the first empty cells to the right of the table. In this case also, the table will increase to accommodate the new columns. Merging rows is actually quite simple, but merging columns can be tricky if the rows of one table don\\'t correspond with the rows in the other table. By using VLOOKUP , you can avoid some of the alignment problems. Merge two tables using the VLOOKUP function In the example shown below, you\\'ll see two tables that previously had other names to new names: \"Blue\" and \"Orange.\" In the Blue table, each row is a line item for an order. So, Order ID 20050 has two items, Order ID 20051', \"has one item, Order ID 20052 has three items, and so on. We want to merge the Sales ID and Region columns with the Blue table, based on matching values in the Order ID columns of the Orange table. Order ID values repeat in the Blue table, but Order ID values in the Orange table are unique. If we were to simply copy-and-paste the data from the Orange table, the Sales ID and Region values for the second line item of order 20050 would be off by one row, which would change the values in the new columns in the Blue table. Here's the data for the Blue table, which you can copy into a blank worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the Excel table Blue. Order ID Sale Date Product ID 20050 2/2/14 C6077B 20050 2/2/14 C9250LB 20051 2/2/14 M115A 20052 2/3/14 A760G 20052 2/3/14 E3331 20052 2/3/14 SP1447 20053 2/3/14 L88M 20054 2/4/14 S1018MM 20055 2/5/14 C6077B 20056 2/6/14 E3331 20056 2/6/14 D534X Here's the data for the Orange table. Copy it into the same worksheet. After you paste it into the worksheet, press Ctrl+T to convert it into a table, and then rename the table Orange. Order ID Sales ID Region 20050 447 West 20051 398 South 20052 1006 North 20053 447 West 20054 885 East 20055 398 South 20056 644 East 20057 1270 East 20058 885 East We need to ensure that the Sales ID and Region values for each order align correctly with each unique order line item. To do this, let's paste the table headings Sales ID and Region into the cells to the right of the Blue table, and use VLOOKUP formulas to get the correct values from the Sales ID and Region columns of the Orange table. Here's how: Copy the headings Sales ID and Region in the Orange table (only those two\", 'cells). Paste the headings into the cell, to the right of the Product ID heading of the Blue table. Now, the Blue table is five columns wide, including the new Sales ID and Region columns. In the Blue table, in the first cell beneath Sales ID, start writing this formula: =VLOOKUP( In the Blue table, pick the first cell in the Order ID column, 20050. The partially completed formula looks like this: The [@[Order ID]] part means \"get the value in this same row from the Order ID column.\" Type a comma, and select the entire Orange table with your mouse so that \"Orange[#All]\" is added to the formula. Type another comma, 2, another comma, and 0—like this: ,2,0 Press Enter, and the completed formula looks like this: The Orange[#All] part means \"look in all the cells in the Orange table.\" The 2 means \"get the value from the second column,\" and the 0 means \"return the value only if there\\'s an exact match.\" Notice that Excel filled the cells down in that column, using the VLOOKUP formula. Return to step 3, but this time start writing the same formula in the first cell beneath Region. In step 6, replace 2 with 3, so the completed formula looks like this: There\\'s just one difference between this formula and the first formula—the first gets values from column 2 of the Orange table, and the second gets them from column 3. Now you\\'ll see values in every cell of the new columns in the Blue table. They contain VLOOKUP formulas, but they\\'ll show the values. You\\'ll want to convert the VLOOKUP formulas in those cells to their actual values. Select all the value cells in the Sales ID column, and press Ctrl+C to copy them. Click Home > arrow below Paste . In the Paste gallery, click Paste Values . Select all the value cells in the Region column, copy them, and repeat steps 10 and 11. Now the VLOOKUP formulas in the two columns have been replaced with the values.

Access Forms and reports Forms Forms Create a form that contains a subform (a one-to-many form) Create a form that contains a subform (a one-to-many form) Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less When you are working with relational data (related data that is stored in separate tables) in Access, you often need to view multiple tables or queries on the same form. For example, you might want to see customer data from one table and information about customer orders from another table at the same time. Subforms are a convenient tool for doing this, and Access provides several ways to help you create subforms quickly. What do you want to do? Learn about subforms Create or add a subform Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Open a subform in a new window in Design view Change the default view of a subform Add related data to a form without creating a subform Learn about', 'subforms A subform is a form that is inserted in another form. The primary form is called the main form, and the form that is enclosed in form is called the subform. A form/subform combination is sometimes referred to as a hierarchical form, a master/detail form, or a parent/child form. Subforms are especially effective when you want to show data from tables or queries that have a one-to-many relationship. A one-to-many relationship is an association between two tables in which the primary key value of each record in the primary table corresponds to the value in the matching field or fields of many records in the related table. For example, you can create a form that displays employee data, and contains a subform that displays each employee\\'s orders. The data in the Employees table is the \"one\" side of the relationship. The data in the Orders table is the \"many\" side of the relationship — each employee can have more than one order. 1. The main form shows data from the \"one\" side of the relationship. 2. The subform shows data from the \"many\" side of the relationship. The main form and subform in this kind of form are linked so that the subform displays only records that are related to the current record in the main form. For example, when the main form displays Nancy Freehafer\\'s information, the subform displays only her orders. If the form and subform were unlinked, the subform would display all the orders, not just Nancy\\'s. The following table defines some of the terminology that is associated with subforms. Access will handle most of the details if you use the procedures in this article, but it is helpful to know what is occurring behind the scenes if you need to make modifications later. Term Definition Subform control The control that embeds a form into a form. You can think of the subform control as a \"view\" of another object in your database, whether it is another form, a table, or a query. The subform control provides properties which allow you to link the data displayed in the control to the data on the main form. Source Object property The property of the subform control that determines what object is displayed in the control. Datasheet A simple display of data in rows and columns, much like a spreadsheet. The subform control displays a datasheet when its source object is a table or query, or when its source object is a form', 'whose Default View property is set to Datasheet. In these cases, the subform is sometimes referred to as a datasheet or subdatasheet instead of as a subform. Link Child Fields property The property of the subform control that specifies which field or fields in the subform link the subform to the main form. Link Master Fields property The property of the subform control that specifies which field or fields on the main form link the main form to the subform. Notes: For best results, establish table relationships before following the procedures in this article. This enables Access to automatically create the links between subforms and main forms. To view, add, or modify relationships between the tables in your database, on the Database Tools tab, in the Relationships group, click Relationships . When a subform control has a form as its source object, it contains the fields that you place on the form, and it can be viewed as a single form, continuous form, or datasheet. One advantage of basing a subform on a form object is that you can add calculated fields to the subform, such as [Quantity] * [Unit price] . You can insert a datasheet or pivot view into a form by creating a subform control whose source object is a table or query. For more information, see the section Add related data to a form without creating a subform . Top of Page Create or add a subform Use the following table to determine which procedure is most appropriate for your situation. Scenario Recommended procedure You want Access to create both a main form and a subform, and to link the subform to the main form. Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard You want to use an existing form as the main form, but you want Access to create a new subform and add it to the main form. Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the Subform Wizard You want to use an existing form as the main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Create a form that contains a subform by using the Form Wizard This procedure creates a new form and subform combination by using the Form Wizard. This is also the quickest way to get started if you have not already created the forms that you want to use as the main form or the subform. On the Create tab, in the Forms group,', 'click Form Wizard . On the first page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select a table or query. For this example, to create an Employees form that displays orders for each employee in a subform, we will select Table: Employees (the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Note: It does not matter which table or query you choose first. Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. On the same page of the wizard, in the Tables/Queries drop-down list, select another table or query from the list. For this example, we will select the Orders table (the \"many\" side of the one-to-many relationship). Double-click the fields that you want to include from this table or query. When you click Next , assuming that you set up the relationships correctly before you started the wizard, the wizard asks How do you want to view your data? — that is, by which table or query. Select the table on the \"one\" side of the one-to-many relationship. For this example, to create the Employees form, we will click by Employees . The wizard displays a small diagram of a form. The page should resemble the following illustration: The box in the lower portion of the form diagram represents the subform. Note: If the wizard does not ask How do you want to view your data? , that means that Access did not detect a one-to-many relationship between the tables or queries that you selected. The wizard will continue, but Access will not add a subform to the form. You might want to click Cancel and examine your table relationships before you continue. At the bottom of the wizard page, select Form with subform(s) , and then click Next . On the What layout would you like for your subform? page, click the layout option that you want, and then click Next . Both layout styles arrange the subform data in rows and columns, but a tabular layout is more customizable. You can add color, graphics, and other formatting elements to a tabular subform, whereas a datasheet is more compact, like the datasheet view of a table. On the next page of the wizard, select a formatting style for the form, and then click Next . If you chose Tabular on the previous page, the formatting style you choose will also be applied to the subform. On the last page of the wizard, type the titles that you want', \"for the forms. Access names the forms based on the titles that you type, and labels the subform based on the title that you type for the subform. Specify whether you want to open the form in Form view, so that you can view or enter information, or in Design view, so that you can modify its design, and then click Finish. Access creates two forms — one for the main form that contains the subform control, and one for the subform itself. Top of Page Add one or more subforms to an existing form by using the SubForm Wizard Use this procedure to add one or more subforms to an existing form. For each subform, you can choose to have Access create a new form or use an existing form as the subform. Right-click the existing form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the down-arrow to display the Controls gallery, and ensure that Use Control Wizards is selected. On the Form Design tab, in the Controls group, click the Subform/Subreport button. Click on the form where you want to place the subform. Follow the directions in the wizard. When you click Finish , Access adds a subform control to your form. If you chose to have Access create a new form for the subform instead of using an existing form, Access creates the new form object and adds it to the Navigation Pane. Create a subform by dragging one form onto another Use this procedure if you want to use an existing form as a main form, and you want to add one or more existing forms to that form as subforms. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the form that you want to use as the main form, and then click Layout View . Drag the form that you want to use as the subform from the Navigation Pane onto the main form. Access adds a subform control to the main form and binds the control to the form that you dragged from the Navigation Pane. Access also tries to link the subform to the main form, based on the relationships that have been defined in your database. Repeat this step to add any additional subforms to the main form. To verify that the linking was successful, on the Home tab, in the Views group, click View , click Form View , and then use the main form's record selector to advance through several records. If the subform filters itself correctly for each employee, then the procedure is\", 'complete. If the previous test does not work, Access was unable to determine how to link the subform to the main form, and the Link Child Fields and Link Master Fields properties of the subform control are blank. You must set these properties manually by doing the following: Right-click the main form in the Navigation Pane, and then click Design View . Click the subform control one time to select it. If the Property Sheet task pane is not displayed, press F4 to display it. In the Property Sheet, click the Data tab. Click the Build button next to the Link Child Fields property box. The Subform Field Linker dialog box appears. In the Master Fields and Child Fields drop-down lists, select the fields that you want to link the forms with, and then click OK . If you are not sure which fields to use, click Suggest to have Access try to determine the linking fields. Tip: If you do not see the field that you want to use to link the forms, you might need to edit the record source of the master form or child form to help make sure that the linking field is in it. For example, if the form is based on a query, you should make sure that the linking field is present in the query results. Save the main form, switch to Form view, and then verify that the form works as expected. Open a subform in a new window in Design view If you want to make design changes to a subform while you are working on its main form in Design view, you can open the subform in its own window: Click the subform to select it. On the Form Design tab, in the Tools group, click Subform in New Window . Top of Page Change the default view of a subform When you add a subform to a form, the subform/subreport control displays the subform according to the subform’s Default View property. This property can be set to the following values: Single Form Continuous Forms Datasheet Split Form When you first create a subform, this property may be set to Continuous Forms or perhaps Single Form . However, if you set the Default View property of a subform to Datasheet , then the subform will display as a datasheet on the main form. To set the Default View property of a subform: Close any open objects. In the Navigation Pane, right-click the subform and then click Design View . If the Property Sheet is not already', \"displayed, press F4 to display it. In the drop-down list at the top of the Property Sheet, make sure Form is selected. On the Format tab of the Property Sheet, set the Default View property to the view you want to use. Note: If the view you want to use is not in the list, make sure the “Allow…View” property for the view is set to Yes . For example, if you want to specify Datasheet as the default view for the form, make sure that the Allow Datasheet View property is set to Yes . Save and close the subform, and then open the main form to check the results. Top of Page Add related data to a form without creating a subform It is not always necessary to create a separate form object to display related data. For example, if you are working on a form in Layout view or Design view and you drag a table or query from the Navigation Pane to the form, Access creates a subform/subreport control that displays the data in that object. The object’s Default View property determines how the data is displayed. Usually, this is set to Datasheet view, but you can also set the Default View property of a table or query to Single Form , Split Form , or Continuous Forms , giving you more flexibility in displaying related data on forms. Note: Changing the Default View property for a table or query determines how it is displayed whenever it is opened, whether you open it from the Navigation Pane or view it in a subform/subreport control. Because changing the view settings for a table can sometimes cause confusion when opening the table from the Navigation Pane, we recommend using a query for this procedure instead of a table.

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail', 'address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers', 'table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you', 'can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table', 'and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations', \"on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Related topics Formulas & functions XLOOKUP Excel Help & Training Formulas & functions Formulas & functions XLOOKUP Overview of formulas in Excel Article XLOOKUP Article VLOOKUP Article SUM function Article COUNTIF function Article IF function Article IFS Article SUMIF Article SUMIFS Article MATCH Article Next: Common uses of functions XLOOKUP function Use the XLOOKUP function to find things in a table or range by row. For example, look up the price of an automotive part by the part number, or find an employee name based on their employee ID. With XLOOKUP, you can look in one column for a search term and return a result from the same row in another column, regardless of which side the return column is on. Note: XLOOKUP is not available in Excel 2016 and Excel 2019, however, you may come across a situation of using a workbook in Excel 2016 or Excel 2019 with the', \"XLOOKUP function in it created by someone else using a newer version of Excel. Syntax The XLOOKUP function searches a range or an array, and then returns the item corresponding to the first match it finds. If no match exists, then XLOOKUP can return the closest (approximate) match. =XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode]) Argument Description lookup_value Required* The value to search for *If omitted, XLOOKUP returns blank cells it finds in lookup_array . lookup_array Required The array or range to search return_array Required The array or range to return [if_not_found] Optional Where a valid match is not found, return the [if_not_found] text you supply. If a valid match is not found, and [if_not_found] is missing, #N/A is returned. [match_mode] Optional Specify the match type: 0 - Exact match. If none found, return #N/A. This is the default. -1 - Exact match. If none found, return the next smaller item. 1 - Exact match. If none found, return the next larger item. 2 - A wildcard match where *, ?, and ~ have special meaning . [search_mode] Optional Specify the search mode to use: 1 - Perform a search starting at the first item. This is the default. -1 - Perform a reverse search starting at the last item. 2 - Perform a binary search that relies on lookup_array being sorted in ascending order. If not sorted, invalid results will be returned. -2 - Perform a binary search that relies on lookup_array being sorted in descending order. If not sorted, invalid results will be returned. Examples Example 1 uses XLOOKUP to look up a country name in a range, and then return its telephone country code. It includes the lookup_value (cell F2), lookup_array (range B2:B11), and return_array (range D2:D11) arguments. It doesn't include the match_mode argument, as XLOOKUP produces an exact match by default. Note: XLOOKUP uses a lookup array and a return array, whereas VLOOKUP uses a single table array followed by a column index number. The equivalent VLOOKUP formula in this case would be: =VLOOKUP(F2,B2:D11,3,FALSE) ——————————————————————————— Example 2 looks up\", \"employee information based on an employee ID number. Unlike VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP can return an array with multiple items, so a single formula can return both employee name and department from cells C5:D14. ——————————————————————————— Example 3 adds an if_not_found argument to the preceding example. ——————————————————————————— Example 4 looks in column C for the personal income entered in cell E2, and finds a matching tax rate in column B. It sets the if_not_found argument to return 0 (zero) if nothing is found. The match_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will look for an exact match, and if it can't find one, it returns the next larger item. Finally, the search_mode argument is set to 1 , which means the function will search from the first item to the last. Note: XARRAY's lookup_array column is to the right of the return_array column, whereas VLOOKUP can only look from left-to-right. ——————————————————————————— Example 5 uses a nested XLOOKUP function to perform both a vertical and horizontal match. It first looks for Gross Profit in column B, then looks for Qtr1 in the top row of the table (range C5:F5), and finally returns the value at the intersection of the two. This is similar to using the INDEX and MATCH functions together. Tip: You can also use XLOOKUP to replace the HLOOKUP function. Note: The formula in cells D3:F3 is: =XLOOKUP(D2,$B6:$B17,XLOOKUP($C3,$C5:$G5,$C6:$G17)) . ——————————————————————————— Example 6 uses the SUM function , and two nested XLOOKUP functions, to sum all the values between two ranges. In this case, we want to sum the values for grapes, bananas, and include pears, which are between the two. The formula in cell E3 is: =SUM(XLOOKUP(B3,B6:B10,E6:E10):XLOOKUP(C3,B6:B10,E6:E10)) How does it work? XLOOKUP returns a range, so when it calculates, the formula ends up looking like this: =SUM($E$7:$E$9) . You can see how this works on your own by selecting a cell with an XLOOKUP formula similar to this one, then select Formulas >\", \"Formula Auditing > Evaluate Formula , and then select Evaluate to step through the calculation. Note: Thanks to Microsoft Excel MVP, Bill Jelen , for suggesting this example. ——————————————————————————— See also You can always ask an expert in the Excel Tech Community or get support in Communities .

Introduction to What-If Analysis Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel 2021 Excel 2021 for Mac Excel 2019 Excel 2019 for Mac Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less By using What-If Analysis tools in Excel, you can use several different sets of values in one or more formulas to explore all the various results. For example, you can do What-If Analysis to build two budgets that each assumes a certain level of revenue. Or, you can specify a result that you want a formula to produce, and then determine what sets of values will produce that result. Excel provides several different tools to help you perform the type of analysis that fits your needs. Note that this is just an overview of those tools. There are links to help topics for each one specifically. Overview What-If Analysis is the process of changing the values in cells to see how those changes will affect the outcome of formulas on the worksheet. Three kinds of What-If Analysis tools come with Excel: Scenarios , Goal Seek , and Data Tables . Scenarios and Data tables take sets of input values and determine possible results. A Data Table works with', \"only one or two variables, but it can accept many different values for those variables. A Scenario can have multiple variables, but it can only accommodate up to 32 values. Goal Seek works differently from Scenarios and Data Tables in that it takes a result and determines possible input values that produce that result. In addition to these three tools, you can install add-ins that help you perform What-If Analysis, such as the Solver add-in. The Solver add-in is similar to Goal Seek, but it can accommodate more variables. You can also create forecasts by using the fill handle and various commands that are built into Excel. For more advanced models, you can use the Analysis ToolPak add-in . Use scenarios to consider many different variables A Scenario is a set of values that Excel saves and can substitute automatically in cells on a worksheet. You can create and save different groups of values on a worksheet and then switch to any of these new scenarios to view different results. For example, suppose you have two budget scenarios: a worst case and a best case. You can use the Scenario Manager to create both scenarios on the same worksheet, and then switch between them. For each scenario, you specify the cells that change and the values to use for that scenario. When you switch between scenarios, the result cell changes to reflect the different changing cell values. 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell 1. Changing cells 2. Result cell If several people have specific information in separate workbooks that you want to use in scenarios, you can collect those workbooks and merge their scenarios. After you have created or gathered all the scenarios that you need, you can create a Scenario Summary Report that incorporates information from those scenarios. A scenario report displays all the scenario information in one table on a new worksheet. Note: Scenario reports are not automatically recalculated. If you change the values of a scenario, those changes will not show up in an existing summary report. Instead, you must create a new summary report. Use Goal Seek to find out how to get a desired result If you know the result that you want from a formula, but you're not sure what input value the formula requires to get that result, you can use the Goal Seek feature. For example, suppose that you need to borrow some money. You know how much money you want, how long a period you want in which to pay off the loan, and how much you can afford to pay each month. You can use Goal\", 'Seek to determine what interest rate you must secure in order to meet your loan goal. Cells B1, B2, and B3 are the values for the loan amount, term length, and interest rate. Cell B4 displays the result of the formula =PMT(B3/12,B2,B1) . Note: Goal Seek works with only one variable input value. If you want to determine more than one input value, for example, the loan amount and the monthly payment amount for a loan, you should instead use the Solver add-in. For more information about the Solver add-in, see the section Prepare forecasts and advanced business models , and follow the links in the See Also section. Use Data Tables to see the effects of one or two variables on a formula If you have a formula that uses one or two variables, or multiple formulas that all use one common variable, you can use a Data Table to see all the outcomes in one place. Using Data Tables makes it easy to examine a range of possibilities at a glance. Because you focus on only one or two variables, results are easy to read and share in tabular form. If automatic recalculation is enabled for the workbook, the data in Data Tables immediately recalculates; as a result, you always have fresh data. Cell B3 contains the input value. Cells C3, C4, and C5 are values Excel substitutes based on the value entered in B3. A Data Table cannot accommodate more than two variables. If you want to analyze more than two variables, you can use Scenarios. Although it is limited to only one or two variables, a Data Table can use as many different variable values as you want. A Scenario can have a maximum of 32 different values, but you can create as many scenarios as you want. Prepare forecasts and advanced business models If you want to prepare forecasts, you can use Excel to automatically generate future values that are based on existing data, or to automatically generate extrapolated values that are based on linear trend or growth trend calculations. You can fill in a series of values that fit a simple linear trend or an exponential growth trend by using the fill handle or the Series command. To extend complex and nonlinear data, you can use worksheet functions or the regression analysis tool in the Analysis ToolPak Add-in. Although Goal Seek can accommodate only one variable, you can project backward for more variables by using the Solver add-in . By using Solver, you can find an optimal', \"value for a formula in one cell—called the target cell—on a worksheet. Solver works with a group of cells that are related to the formula in the target cell. Solver adjusts the values in the changing cells that you specify—called the adjustable cells—to produce the result that you specify from the target cell formula. You can apply constraints to restrict the values that Solver can use in the model, and the constraints can refer to other cells that affect the target cell formula. Need more help?

Excel Import and analyze data PivotTables PivotTables Calculate values in a PivotTable Calculate values in a PivotTable Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel for Microsoft 365 for Mac Excel for the web Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less In PivotTables, you can use summary functions in value fields to combine values from the underlying source data. If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The PivotTable would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. Another way to calculate is to use Measures in Power Pivot, which you create using a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula. For more information, see Create a Measure in Power Pivot . About calculations Windows, Mac Web iPad \\ue70d PivotTables provide ways to calculate data. Learn about the calculation methods that are available, how calculations are affected by the type of source data, and how to use formulas in PivotTables and PivotCharts. Available calculation methods', 'To calculate values in a PivotTable, you can use any or all of the following types of calculation methods: Summary functions in value fields The data in the values area summarize the underlying source data in the PivotTable. For example, the following source data: Produces the following PivotTables and PivotCharts. If you create a PivotChart from the data in a PivotTable, the values in that PivotChart reflect the calculations in the associated PivotTable report. In the PivotTable, the Month column field provides the items March and April . The Region row field provides the items North , South , East , and West . The value at the intersection of the April column and the North row is the total sales revenue from the records in the source data that have Month values of April and Region values of North . In a PivotChart, the Region field might be a category field that shows North , South , East , and West as categories. The Month field could be a series field that shows the items March , April , and May as series represented in the legend. A Values field named Sum of Sales could contain data markers that represent the total revenue in each region for each month. For example, one data marker would represent, by its position on the vertical (value) axis, the total sales for April in the North region. To calculate the value fields, the following summary functions are available for all types of source data except Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) source data. Function Summarizes Sum The sum of the values. This is the default function for numeric data. Count The number of data values. The Count summary function works the same as the COUNTA function . Count is the default function for data other than numbers. Average The average of the values. Max The largest value. Min The smallest value. Product The product of the values. Count Nums The number of data values that are numbers. The Count Nums summary function works the same as the COUNT function . StDev An estimate of the standard deviation of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StDevp The standard deviation of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Var An estimate of the variance of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Varp The variance of a population, where the population is all of the data to be summarized. Custom calculations A custom calculation shows values based on other items or cells in the data area. For', 'example, you could display values in the Sum of Sales data field as a percentage of March sales, or as a running total of the items in the Month field. The following functions are available for custom calculations in value fields. Function Result No Calculation Displays the value that is entered in the field. % of Grand Total Displays values as a percentage of the grand total of all of the values or data points in the report. % of Column Total Displays all of the values in each column or series as a percentage of the total for the column or series. % of Row Total Displays the value in each row or category as a percentage of the total for the row or category. % Of Displays values as a percentage of the value of the Base item in the Base field . % of Parent Row Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item on rows) % of Parent Column Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item on columns) % of Parent Total Calculates values as follows: (value for the item) / (value for the parent item of the selected Base field ) Difference From Displays values as the difference from the value of the Base item in the Base field . % Difference From Displays values as the percentage difference from the value of the Base item in the Base field . Running Total in Displays the value for successive items in the Base field as a running total. % Running Total in Calculates the value for successive items in the Base field that are displayed as a running total as a percentage. Rank Smallest to Largest Displays the rank of selected values in a specific field, listing the smallest item in the field as 1, and each larger value will have a higher rank value. Rank Largest to Smallest Displays the rank of selected values in a specific field, listing the largest item in the field as 1, and each smaller value will have a higher rank value. Index Calculates values as follows: ((value in cell) x (Grand Total of Grand Totals)) / ((Grand Row Total) x (Grand Column Total)) Formulas If summary functions and custom calculations do not provide the results that you want, you can create your own formulas in calculated fields and calculated items. For example, you could add a calculated item with the formula for the sales commission, which could be different for each region. The report would then automatically include the commission in the subtotals and grand totals. How the type of source', \"data affects calculations Calculations and options that are available in a report depend on whether the source data came from an OLAP database or a non-OLAP data source. Calculations based on OLAP source data For PivotTables that are created from OLAP cubes, the summarized values are precalculated on the OLAP server before Excel displays the results. You cannot change how these precalculated values are calculated in the PivotTable. For example, you cannot change the summary function that is used to calculate data fields or subtotals, or add calculated fields or calculated items. Also, if the OLAP server provides calculated fields, known as calculated members, you will see these fields in the PivotTable Field List. You will also see any calculated fields and calculated items that are created by macros that were written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and stored in your workbook, but you won't be able to change these fields or items. If you need additional types of calculations, contact your OLAP database administrator. For OLAP source data, you can include or exclude the values for hidden items when calculating subtotals and grand totals. Calculations based on non-OLAP source data In PivotTables that are based on other types of external data or on worksheet data, Excel uses the Sum summary function to calculate value fields that contain numeric data, and the Count summary function to calculate data fields that contain text. You can choose a different summary function, such as, Average, Max, or Min, to further analyze and customize your data. You can also create your own formulas that use elements of the report or other worksheet data by creating a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Using formulas in PivotTables You can create formulas only in reports that are based on a non-OLAP source data. You cannot use formulas in reports that are based on an OLAP database. When you use formulas in PivotTables, you should know about the following formula syntax rules and formula behavior: PivotTable formula elements In formulas that you create for calculated fields and calculated items, you can use operators and expressions as you do in other worksheet formulas. You can use constants and refer to data from the report, but you cannot use cell references or defined names. You cannot use worksheet functions that require cell references or defined names as arguments, and you cannot use array functions. Field and item names Excel uses field and item names to identify those elements of a report in your formulas. In the following example, the\", \"data in range C3:C9 is using the field name Dairy . A calculated item in the Type field that estimates sales for a new product based on Dairy sales could use a formula such as =Dairy * 115% . Note: In a PivotChart, the field names are displayed in the PivotTable field list, and item names can be seen in each field drop-down list. Don't confuse these names with those you see in chart tips, which reflect series and data point names instead. Formulas operate on sum totals, not individual records Formulas for calculated fields operate on the sum of the underlying data for any fields in the formula. For example, the calculated field formula =Sales * 1.2 multiplies the sum of the sales for each type and region by 1.2; it does not multiply each individual sale by 1.2 and then sum the multiplied amounts. Formulas for calculated items operate on the individual records. For example, the calculated item formula =Dairy *115% multiplies each individual sale of Dairy times 115%, after which the multiplied amounts are summarized together in the Values area. Spaces, numbers, and symbols in names In a name that includes more than one field, the fields can be in any order. In the example above, cells C6:D6 can be 'April North' or 'North April' . Use single quotation marks around names that are more than one word or that include numbers or symbols. Totals Formulas cannot refer to totals (such as, March Total , April Total , and Grand Total in the example). Field names in item references You can include the field name in a reference to an item. The item name must be in square brackets — for example, Region[North] . Use this format to avoid #NAME? errors when two items in two different fields in a report have the same name. For example, if a report has an item named Meat in the Type field and another item named Meat in the Category field, you can prevent #NAME? errors by referring to the items as Type[Meat] and Category[Meat] . Referring to items by position You can refer to an item by its position in the report as currently sorted and displayed. Type[1] is Dairy , and Type[2] is Seafood . The item referred to in this way can change whenever the positions of items change or different items are displayed or hidden. Hidden items are not counted in this\", 'index. You can use relative positions to refer to items. The positions are determined relative to the calculated item that contains the formula. If South is the current region, Region[-1] is North ; if North is the current region, Region[+1] is South . For example, a calculated item could use the formula =Region[-1] * 3% . If the position that you give is before the first item or after the last item in the field, the formula results in a #REF! error. Using formulas in PivotCharts To use formulas in a PivotChart, you create the formulas in the associated PivotTable, where you can see the individual values that make up your data, and then you can view the results graphically in the PivotChart. For example, the following PivotChart shows sales for each salesperson per region: To see what sales would look like if they were increased by 10 percent, you could create a calculated field in the associated PivotTable that uses a formula such as =Sales * 110% . The result immediately appears in the PivotChart, as shown in the following chart: To see a separate data marker for sales in the North region minus a transportation cost of 8 percent, you could create a calculated item in the Region field with a formula such as =North – (North * 8%) . The resulting chart would look like this: However, a calculated item that is created in the Salesperson field would appear as a series represented in the legend and appear in the chart as a data point in each category. Create formulas in a PivotTable Important: You cannot create formulas in a PivotTable that is connected to an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data source. Before you start, decide whether you want a calculated field or a calculated item within a field. Use a calculated field when you want to use the data from another field in your formula. Use a calculated item when you want your formula to use data from one or more specific items within a field. For calculated items, you can enter different formulas cell by cell. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCounty has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can adjust the order of calculation. Add a calculated field Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze', 'and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, type a name for the field. In the Formula box, enter the formula for the field. To use the data from another field in the formula, click the field in the Fields box, and then click Insert Field . For example, to calculate a 15% commission on each value in the Sales field, you could enter = Sales * 15% . Click Add . Add a calculated item to a field Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. If items in the field are grouped, on the Analyze tab, in the Group group, click Ungroup . Click the field where you want to add the calculated item. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Item . In the Name box, type a name for the calculated item. In the Formula box, enter the formula for the item. To use the data from an item in the formula, click the item in the Items list, and then click Insert Item (the item must be from the same field as the calculated item). Click Add . Enter different formulas cell by cell for calculated items Click a cell for which you want to change the formula. To change the formula for several cells, hold down CTRL and click the additional cells. In the formula bar, type the changes to the formula. Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Solve Order . Click a formula, and then click Move Up or Move Down . Continue until the formulas are in the order that you want them to be calculated. View all formulas that are used in a PivotTable You can display a list of all the formulas that are used in the current PivotTable. Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . Edit a PivotTable formula Before you edit a formula, determine whether that formula is in a calculated field or a calculated', 'item. If the formula is in a calculated item, also determine whether the formula is the only one for the calculated item. For calculated items, you can edit individual formulas for specific cells of a calculated item. For example, if a calculated item named OrangeCalc has a formula of =Oranges * .25 across all months, you can change the formula to =Oranges *.5 for June, July, and August. Determine whether a formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click List Formulas . In the list of formulas, find the formula that you want to change listed under Calculated Field or Calculated Item. When there are multiple formulas for a calculated item, the default formula that was entered when the item was created has the calculated item name in column B. For additional formulas for a calculated item, column B contains both the calculated item name and the names of intersecting items. For example, you might have a default formula for a calculated item named MyItem , and another formula for this item identified as MyItem January Sales . In the PivotTable, you would find this formula in the Sales cell for the MyItem row and January column. Continue by using one of the following editing methods. Edit a calculated field formula Click the PivotTable. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field . In the Name box, select the calculated field for which you want to change the formula. In the Formula box, edit the formula. Click Modify . Edit a single formula for a calculated item Click the field that contains the calculated item. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Item . In the Name box, select the calculated item. In the Formula box, edit the formula. Click Modify . Edit an individual formula for a specific cell of a calculated item Click a cell for which you want to change the formula. To change the formula for several cells, hold down CTRL and click the additional cells. In the formula bar, type the changes to the formula. Tip: If you have multiple calculated items or formulas, you can', 'adjust the order of calculation. For more information, see Adjust the order of calculation for multiple calculated items or formulas . Delete a PivotTable formula Note: Deleting a PivotTable formula removes it permanently. If you do not want to remove a formula permanently, you can hide the field or item instead by dragging it out of the PivotTable. Determine whether the formula is in a calculated field or a calculated item. Calculated fields appear in the PivotTable Field List. Calculated items appear as items within other fields. Do one of the following: To delete a calculated field, click anywhere in the PivotTable. To delete a calculated item, in the PivotTable, click the field that contains the item that you want to delete. This displays the PivotTable Tools, adding the Analyze and Design tabs. On the Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click Fields, Items, & Sets , and then click Calculated Field or Calculated Item . In the Name box, select the field or item that you want to delete. Click Delete . To summarize values in a PivotTable in Excel for the web, you can use summary functions like Sum, Count, and Average.

For example, you may want to review the employee records of employees who have processed at least one order to determine which employees are eligible for a bonus. Or, you may want to review contact information for customers who live in the same city as an employee so that you can match employees with a customers for in-person meetings. When you want to compare two Access tables and find matching data, you can either: Create a query that joins fields from each table where those fields contain corresponding information, either by using an existing relationship or by using a join that you create for the purpose of the query. This method provides optimum performance (the speed with which the query returns results), but you cannot join fields that have dissimilar data types. Create a query that compares fields by using one field', \"as a criterion for the other. Using a field as a criterion for another field is generally slower than using joins, because joins eliminate rows from a query's results before the underlying tables are read, whereas criteria are applied to a query's results after the underlying tables are read. However, you can use a field as a field criterion to compare fields that have dissimilar data types, which you cannot do by using joins. This article discusses how to compare two tables to identify matching data, and provides sample data that you can use with example procedures. What do you want to do? Compare two tables by using joins Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Compare two tables by using joins To compare two tables by using joins, you create a select query that includes both tables. If there is not already an existing relationship between the tables on the fields that contain the corresponding data, you create a join on the fields that you want to examine for matches. You can create as many joins as you want, but each pair of joined fields must be of the same or compatible data type. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a table that stores student major data and a table that stores class enrollment data. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors since the recent curriculum changes, you need to review records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. Prepare sample data In this example, you build a query that determines how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected math students' grades. You use the following two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments. Add these two sample tables, Student Majors and Class Enrollments, to a database. Access provides several ways to add these sample tables to a database. You can enter the data manually, you can copy each table into a spreadsheet program (such as Microsoft Office Excel 2007), and then import the worksheets into Access, or you can paste the data into a text editor, such as Notepad, and then import the data from the resulting text files. The steps in this section explain how to enter data manually in a blank datasheet, and also explain how to copy the sample\", 'tables to Excel, and then import those tables into Access.

Enter the sample data manually', 'Open a new or existing database. On the Create tab, in the Tables group, click Table . Access adds a new, blank table to your database. Note: You do not need to follow this step if you open a new, blank database, but you will need to follow it whenever you need to add a table to the database. Double-click the first cell in the header row, and then type the name of the field in the sample table. By default, Access denotes blank fields in the header row with the text Add New Field , such as: Use the arrow keys to move to the next blank header cell, and then type the second field name. (You can also double-click the new cell.) Repeat this step for each field name. Enter the data in the sample table. As you enter the data, Access infers a data type for each field. Each field has a specific data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time. Setting data types helps ensure accurate data entry and also helps prevent mistakes, such as using a telephone number in a calculation. For these sample tables, allow Access to infer the data type, but be sure to review the data type that Access infers for each field. After you finish entering the data, click Save , or press CTRL+S. The Save As dialog box appears. In the Table Name box, type the name of the sample table, and then click OK . You use the name of each sample table (for example, Student Majors) because the queries in the procedure sections of this article also use those names. After you finish entering the sample data, you are ready to compare the two tables . Skip the following section (Create the sample worksheets), unless you want to learn how to create a worksheet that is based on the sample data from the tables in the preceding section. Create the sample worksheets Start your spreadsheet program, and create a new, blank file. If you use Excel, a new, blank workbook is created by default when you start the program. Copy the first sample table from the preceding section and paste it into the first worksheet, starting at the first cell. Be sure that you copy the header row, because it contains the field names of the sample table. Using the technique provided by your spreadsheet program, give the worksheet the same name as the sample table. For example, when you paste the Class Enrollments sample data, name the worksheet Class Enrollments. Repeat steps 2 and', '3, copying the second sample table to a blank worksheet and renaming the worksheet. Note: You may need to add worksheets to your spreadsheet file. For information about adding worksheets to your spreadsheet file, see the help for your spreadsheet program. Save the workbook to a convenient location on your computer or your network, and go to the next set of steps. Create database tables from the worksheets In a new or existing database: On the External Data tab, in the Import group, click Excel . -or- Click More , and then select a spreadsheet program from the list. The Get External Data - Program Name Spreadsheet dialog box appears. Click Browse , locate and open the spreadsheet file that you created in the previous steps, and then click OK . The Import Spreadsheet Wizard starts. By default, the wizard selects the first worksheet in the workbook (Student Majors, if you followed the steps in the previous section), and data from that worksheet appears in the lower section of the wizard page. Click Next . On the next page of the wizard, select the First Row Contains Column Headings check box, and then click Next . On the next page, you can use the text boxes and lists under Field Options to change field names and data types, or to omit fields from the import operation. For this example, you do not need to change anything. Click Next . On the next page, select the No primary key option, and then click Next . By default, Access applies the name of the worksheet to your new table. Accept the name in the Import to Table box, and then click Finish . On the Save Import Steps page, click Close to complete the wizard. Repeat steps 1 through 7 until you have created a table from each worksheet in the spreadsheet file. Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using joins Now you are ready to compare the Class Enrollments table and the Student Majors table. Because you have not defined relationships between the two tables, you need to create joins between the appropriate fields in the query. The tables have more than one field in common, and you will need to create a join for each pair of common fields: Student ID, Year, and Curriculum (Class Enrollments table) and Major (Student Majors table). In this example, you are only interested in math majors, so you will also use a field criterion to limit the query results. Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. On the Create tab, click Query Design .', \"Double-click the table that contains the records that you want to display — in this example, the Class Enrollments table, and then double-click the table to which you are comparing it — in this example, the Student Majors table. Drag the Student ID field from the Class Enrollments table to the Student ID field of the Student Majors table. A line appears between the two tables in the design grid, indicating that you have created a join. Double-click the line to open the Join Properties dialog box. Review the three options in the Join Properties dialog box. By default, option 1 is selected. In some cases, you need to adjust the join properties to include extra rows from one table. Because you are trying to find only matching data, leave the join set to option 1. Close the Join Properties dialog box by clicking Cancel . You will need to create two other joins. Create these joins by dragging the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then by dragging the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field on the Student Majors table. In the Class Enrollments table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) to add all of the table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column in the query design grid. In the Criteria row of the Major column, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Compare two tables by using a field as a criterion Sometimes you may want to compare tables on the basis of fields that have matching data, but have different data types. For example, a field in one table may have a Number data type, and you want to compare that field to a field in another table that has a Text data type. Fields that contain similar data yet have different field types can result when numbers are stored as text, either by design, or for other reasons, such as importing\", \"data from another program. Because you cannot create joins between fields that have different data types, you will need to use a different method to compare the fields. You can compare two fields that have different data types by using one field as a criterion for the other. Suppose that you are an institutional researcher at a college and you want see how recent curriculum changes in the math department have affected students' grades. You are specifically interested in the grades of students who are math majors. You already have a Student Majors table and a Class Enrollments table. Grade data is stored in the Class Enrollments table, and student major data is stored in the Student Majors table. To see how grades have changed for math majors, you need to look at records from the enrollments table that have corresponding records in the majors table. However, one of the fields that you want to use to compare the tables has a different data type from its counterpart. To compare two tables by using a field as a criterion, you create a select query that includes both tables. You include the fields that you want to display, and you also include the field that corresponds to the field that you want to use as a criterion. You then create a criterion to compare the tables. You can create as many criteria to compare fields as you want. To illustrate this method, you will use the sample tables from the previous section , but you will change the data type of the Student ID field of the sample Student Majors table from Number to Text. Because you cannot create a join between two fields that have different data types, you will have to compare the two Student ID fields by using one field as a criterion for the other. Change the data type of the Student Majors Student ID field Open the database in which you saved the sample tables. In the Navigation Pane , right-click the Student Majors table, and then click Design View on the shortcut menu. The Student Majors table opens in Design view. In the Data Type column, change the setting for Student ID from Number to Text . Close the Student Majors table. When you are prompted to save changes, click Yes . Compare the sample tables and find matching records by using a field criterion The following procedure shows how to compare the two Student ID fields by using the field from Class Enrollments as a criterion for the field from Student Majors. By using the Like keyword, you can compare the fields, even though they have different data types. On the Create\", \"tab, in the Other group, click Query Design . Double-click Class Enrollments , and then double-click Student Majors . Drag the Year field from the Class Enrollments table to the Year field of the Student Majors table, and then drag the Curriculum field from the Class Enrollments table to the Major field of the Student Majors table. Because these fields have the same data types, you can compare them by using joins. Joins are the preferred method for comparing fields that have the same data type. Double-click the asterisk ( * ) on the Class Enrollments table to add all of that table's fields to the query design grid. Note: When you use the asterisk to add all fields, only one column appears in the design grid. The column that appears has the name of the table, followed by a period (.) and an asterisk (*). In this example, the column is named Class Enrollments.* . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Student ID field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Student ID column of the design grid. In the Criteria row of the Student ID column, type Like [Class Enrollments].[Student ID] . In the Student Majors table, double-click the Major field to add it to the grid. Clear the check box in the Show row of the Major column of the design grid. In the Criteria row, type MATH . On the Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . The query runs, and then displays math grades only for math majors. Top of Page Need more help? Want more options?

Access Queries Advanced queries Advanced queries Add records to a table by using an append query Add records to a table by using an append query Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less This article explains how to create and run an append query. You use an append query when you need to add new records to an existing table by using data from other sources. If you need to change data in an existing set of records, such as updating the value of a field, you can use an update query. If you need to make a new table from a selection of data, or to merge two tables into one new table, you can use a make-table query. For more information about update queries or make-table queries, or for general information about other ways to add records to a database or change existing data, see the See Also section. In this article Overview Create and run an append query Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query Overview An append query selects records from one or more data sources and copies the selected records to an existing table. For example, suppose that you acquire a database that contains a table of potential new', \"customers, and that you already have a table in your existing database that stores that kind of data. You'd like to store the data in one place, so you decide to copy it from the new database into your existing table. To avoid entering the new data manually, you can use an append query to copy the records. Benefits of using an append query By using a query to copy data, you can: Append multiple records in one pass If you copy data manually, you usually have to perform multiple copy/paste operations. By using a query, you select all the data at once, and then copy it. Review your selection before you copy it You can view your selection in Datasheet view and can make adjustments to your selection as needed before you copy the data. This can be particularly handy if your query includes criteria or expressions, and you need several tries to get it just right. You cannot undo an append query. If you make a mistake, you must either restore your database from a backup or correct your error, either manually or by using a delete query. Use criteria to refine your selection For example, you might want to only append records of customers who live in your city. Append records when some of the fields in the data sources don't exist in the destination table For example, suppose that your existing customer table has eleven fields, and the new table that you want to copy from only has nine of those eleven fields. You can use an append query to copy the data from the nine fields that match and leave the other two fields blank. Basic steps of an append query The process of creating an append query follows these basic steps: Create a select query You start by selecting the data that you want to copy. You can adjust your select query as needed, and run it as many times as you want to make sure you are selecting the data that you want to copy. Convert the select query to an append query After your selection is ready, you change the query type to Append . Choose the destination fields for each column in the append query In some cases, Access automatically chooses the destination fields for you. You can adjust the destination fields, or choose them if Access did not. Preview and run the query to append the records Before you append the records, you can switch to Datasheet view for a preview of the appended records. Important: You cannot undo an append query. Consider backing up your database or the destination table. Create and run an append query In this section Step\", '1: Create a query to select the records to copy Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query Step 3: Choose the destination fields Step 4: Preview and run the append query Step 1: Create a query to select the records to copy Open the database that contains the records that you want to copy. On the Create tab, in the Queries group, click Query Design . Double-click the tables or queries that contain the records that you want to copy, and then click Close . The tables or queries appear as one or more windows in the query designer. Each window lists the fields in a table or query. This figure shows a typical table in the query designer. 1. Assets table shown in the query designer 2. Query design grid Double-click each field that you want to append. The selected fields appear in the Field row in the query design grid. The data types of the fields in the source table must be compatible with the data types of the fields in the destination table. Text fields are compatible with most other types of fields. Number fields are only compatible with other number fields. For example, you can append numbers to a text field, but you cannot append text into a number field. You can also use an expression as a field — such as =Date() to automatically return today\\'s date — and you can use expressions with table or query fields in the design grid to customize the data that you select. For example, if your destination table has a field that stores a four-digit year and the source table has a regular date/time field, you might use the DatePart function with the source field to select only the year. To quickly add all the fields in a table, double-click the asterisk ( * ) at the top of the list of table fields. This figure shows the design grid with all fields added. Optionally, you can enter one or more criteria in the Criteria row of the design grid. The following table shows some example criteria and explains the effect they have on a query. Criteria Effect > 234 Returns all numbers greater than 234. To find all numbers less than 234, use < 234. >= \"Callahan\" Returns all records from Callahan through the end of the alphabet. Between #2/2/2017# And #12/1/2017# Returns dates from 2-Feb-17 through 1-Dec-17 (ANSI-89). If your database uses the ANSI-92', 'wildcard characters, use single quotation marks (\\') instead of pound signs. Example: Between \\'2/2/2017\\' And \\'12/1/2017\\'. Not \"Germany\" Finds all records where the exact contents of the field are not exactly equal to \"Germany.\" The criterion will return records that contain characters in addition to \"Germany,\" such as \"Germany (euro)\" or \"Europe (Germany)\". Not \"T*\" Finds all records except those beginning with T. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign ( % ) instead of the asterisk ( * ). Not \"*t\" Finds all records that do not end with t. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. In(Canada,UK) In a list, finds all records containing Canada or UK. Like \"[A-D]*\" In a Text field, finds all records that start with the letters A through D. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. Like \"*ar*\" Finds all records that include the letter sequence \"ar\". If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the percent sign instead of the asterisk. Like \"Maison Dewe?\" Finds all records that begin with \"Maison\" and that also contain a 5-letter second string in which the first 4 letters are \"Dewe\" and the last letter is unknown (indicated by a question mark). If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, use the underscore ( _ ) instead of the question mark. #2/2/2017# Finds all records for February 2, 2017. If your database uses the ANSI-92 wildcard character set, surround the date with single quotation marks instead of pound signs ( # ). Example: \\'2/2/2017\\'. < Date() - 30 Returns all dates more than 30 days old. Date() Returns all records containing today\\'s date. Between Date() And DateAdd(\"M\", 3, Date()) Returns all records between today\\'s date and three months from today\\'s date. Is Null Returns all records that contain a null (blank or undefined) value. Is Not Null Returns all records that contain a value. \"\" Returns all records that contain a zero-length string. You use zero-length strings when you need to add a value', 'to a required field, but you don\\'t yet know what that value is. For example, a field may require a fax number, but some of your customers may not have fax machines. In that case, you enter a pair of double quotation marks with no space between them (\"\") instead of a number. On the Query Design tab, in the Results group, click Run . Verify that the query returned the records that you want to copy. If you need to add or remove fields from the query, switch back to Design view and add fields as described in the preceding step, or select the fields that you don\\'t want and press DELETE to remove them from the query. Step 2: Convert the select query to an append query On the Home tab, in the View group, click View , and then click Design View . On the Query Design tab, in the Query Type group, click Append . The Append dialog box appears. Next, you specify whether to append records to a table in the current database, or to a table in a different database. Do one of the following: In the Append dialog box, click Current Database , select the destination table from the Table Name combo box, and then click OK . -or- In the Append dialog box, click Another Database . In the File Name box, enter the location and name of the destination database. In the Table Name combo box, enter the name of the destination table, and then click OK . Step 3: Choose the destination fields The way that you choose destination fields depends on how you created your select query in Step 1. If you... Access... Added all the fields from your source table or query Adds all the fields in the destination table to the Append to row in the design grid Added individual fields to the query or used expressions, and the field names in the source and destination tables match Automatically adds the matching destination fields to the Append to row in the query Added individual fields or used expressions, and any of the names in the source and destination tables don\\'t match Adds the matching fields, and leaves unmatched fields blank If Access leaves fields blank, you can click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. This figure illustrates how you click a cell in the Append to row and select a destination field. Note: If you leave the destination field blank, the query will not append data to that field. Step 4: Preview and run the append query To preview your changes, switch to Datasheet', \"view. Tip: To quickly switch views, right-click the tab at the top of the query, and then click the view that you want. Return to Design view, and then click Run to append the records. Note: While running a query that returns a large amount of data you might get an error message indicating that you will not be able to undo the query. Try increasing the limit on the memory segment to 3MB to allow the query to go through. Top of Page Stop Disabled Mode from blocking a query If you try to run an append query and it seems like nothing happens, check the Access status bar for the following message: This action or event has been blocked by Disabled Mode. To fix this, click Enable Content in the Message Bar to enable the query. Note: When you enable the append query, you also enable all other database content. If you don't see the Message Bar, it may be hidden. You can show it, unless it has also been disabled. If the Message Bar has been disabled, you can enable it.

Access for Microsoft 365 Access 2021 Access 2019 Access 2016 Access 2013 More... Less The Relationships window lets you define relationship between items stored in multiple Access tables. It is available by clicking Database Tools > Relationships . Relationships are like the rules that govern how data is connected in your database. In a well-normalized order-processing database, for example, most likely you’ll have customer information in one table and order information in another table. You want to make sure customers don’t get separated from their orders, right? And you don’t want an order to be created that doesn’t have a valid customer connected to it. The Relationships window is where you go to set these rules so that they apply throughout your database. If you’ve built an Access query before, you’ll notice that the Relationships window looks a lot like the top part of the Query Builder: In the Relationships window, you use the commands on the Design tab to add tables to the view, and then you drag fields between tables to set up the relationships. In this example, the relationship allows for multiple orders to be connected to each customer, but it keeps you from creating an', 'order for a customer that doesn’t exist. Once you set up these rules in the Relationships window, they’ll apply to the whole database (for example, if you create a new query, the joins will automatically be set up according to your relationship rules). Note: Deleting a table from the Relationships window won’t delete it from your database, nor will it remove relationships that you’ve already established. Things you can do Task How to do it Add a table or query to the window Click Design > Add Tables ( Show Table in Access 2013), select the table or query you want, and then click Add . Delete a table or query from the window Select the table or query, and then press DELETE. Hide a table or query Right-click the table or query, and then click Hide Table . Create a relationship Drag a field from one table or query to the corresponding field in the other table or query. Set properties for a relationship Right-click the relationship line between two tables (this can take a few tries to hit it exactly right), and then click Edit Relationship . Delete a relationship Right-click the relationship line between two tables (this can take a few tries to hit it exactly right), and then click Delete . Show all relationships Click Design > All Relationships . View the relationships for a particular table Select the table, and then click Design > Direct Relationships .

Use the Name Manager in Excel Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Use the Name Manager dialog box to work with all the defined names and table names in a workbook. For example, you may want to find names with errors, confirm the value and reference of a name, view or edit descriptive comments, or determine the scope. You can also sort and filter the list of names, and easily add, change, or delete names from one location. To open the Name Manager dialog box, on the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Name Manager . The Name Manager dialog box displays the following information about each name in a list box: Column Name Description Name One of the following: A defined name, which is indicated by a defined name icon. A table name, which is indicated by a table name icon. Note: A table name is the name for an Excel table, which is a collection of data about a particular subject stored in records (rows) and fields (columns). Excel creates a default Excel table name of Table1, Table2, and so on, each time you insert an Excel', 'table. You can change a table\\'s name to make it more meaningful. For more information about Excel tables, see Using structured references with Excel tables . Value The current value of the name, such as the results of a formula, a string constant, a cell range, an error, an array of values, or a placeholder if the formula cannot be evaluated. The following are representative examples: \"this is my string constant\" 3.1459 {2003;12,2002;23,;2001,18} #REF! {...} Refers To The current reference for the name. The following are representative examples: =Sheet1!$A$3 =8.3 =HR!$A$1:$Z$345 =SUM(Sheet1!A1,Sheet2!B2) Scope A worksheet name, if the scope is the local worksheet level. \"Workbook,\" if the scope is the global workbook level. This is the default option. Comment Additional information about the name up to 255 characters. The following are representative examples: This value will expire on May 2, 2007. Don\\'t delete! Critical name! Based on the ISO certification exam numbers. Refers to: The reference for the selected name. You can quickly edit the range of a name by modifying the details in the Refers to box. After making the change you can click Commit to save changes, or click Cancel to discard your changes. Notes: You cannot use the Name Manager dialog box while you are changing the contents of a cell. The Name Manager dialog box does not display names defined in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), or hidden names (the Visible property of the name is set to False). Create a named range On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Define Name . In the New Name dialog box, in the Name box, type the name you want to use for your reference. Note: Names can be up to 255 characters in length. The scope automatically defaults to Workbook . To change the name’s scope, in the Scope drop-down list box, select the name of a worksheet. Optionally, in the Comment box, enter a descriptive comment up to 255 characters. In the Refers to box, do one of the following: Click Collapse Dialog (which temporarily shrinks the dialog box), select the cells on the worksheet, and then click Expand Dialog . To enter a constant, type = (equal sign)', 'and then type the constant value. To enter a formula, type = and then type the formula. Tips: Be careful about using absolute or relative references in your formula. If you create the reference by clicking on the cell you want to refer to, Excel will create an absolute reference, such as \"Sheet1!$B$1\". If you type a reference, such as \"B1\", it is a relative reference. If your active cell is A1 when you define the name, then the reference to \"B1\" really means \"the cell in the next column\". If you use the defined name in a formula in a cell, the reference will be to the cell in the next column relative to where you enter the formula. For example, if you enter the formula in C10, the reference would be D10, and not B1. More information - Switch between relative, absolute, and mixed references To finish and return to the worksheet, click OK . Note: To make the New Name dialog box wider or longer, click and drag the grip handle at the bottom. Edit a name If you modify a defined name or table name, all uses of that name in the workbook are also changed. On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click Name Manager . In the Name Manager dialog box, double-click the name you want to edit, or, click the name that you want to change, and then click Edit . In the Edit Name dialog box, in the Name box, type the new name for the reference. In the Refers to box, change the reference, and then click OK .

Relationships between tables in a Data Model Excel for Microsoft 365 Excel 2021 Excel 2019 Excel 2016 Excel 2013 More... Less Add more power to your data analysis by creating relationships amogn different tables. A relationship is a connection between two tables that contain data: one column in each table is the basis for the relationship. To see why relationships are useful, imagine that you track data for customer orders in your business. You could track all the data in a single table having a structure like this: CustomerID Name EMail DiscountRate OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com .05 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com .10 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 This approach can work, but it involves storing a lot of redundant data, such as the customer e-mail address for every order. Storage is cheap, but if the e-mail', 'address changes you have to make sure you update every row for that customer. One solution to this problem is to split the data into multiple tables and define relationships between those tables. This is the approach used in relational databases like SQL Server. For example, a database that you import might represent order data by using three related tables: Customers [CustomerID] Name Email 1 Ashton chris.ashton@contoso.com 2 Jaworski michal.jaworski@contoso.com CustomerDiscounts [CustomerID] DiscountRate 1 .05 2 .10 Orders [CustomerID] OrderID OrderDate Product Quantity 1 256 2010-01-07 Compact Digital 11 1 255 2010-01-03 SLR Camera 15 2 254 2010-01-03 Budget Movie-Maker 27 Relationships exist within a Data Model—one that you explicitly create, or one that Excel automatically creates on your behalf when you simultaneously import multiple tables. You can also use the Power Pivot add-in to create or manage the model. See Create a Data Model in Excel for details. If you use the Power Pivot add-in to import tables from the same database, Power Pivot can detect the relationships between the tables based on the columns that are in [brackets], and can reproduce these relationships in a Data Model that it builds behind the scenes. For more information, see Automatic Detection and Inference of Relationships in this article. If you import tables from multiple sources, you can manually create relationships as described in Create a relationship between two tables . Columns and keys Relationships are based on columns in each table that contain the same data. For example, you could relate a Customers table with an Orders table if each contains a column that stores a Customer ID . In the example, the column names are the same, but this is not a requirement. One could be CustomerID and another CustomerNumber, as long as all of the rows in the Orders table contain an ID that is also stored in the Customers table. In a relational database, there are several types of keys. A key is typically column with special properties. Understanding the purpose of each key can help you manage a multi-table Data Model that provides data to a PivotTable, PivotChart, or Power View report. Though there are many types of keys, these are the most important for our purpose here: Primary key: uniquely identifies a row in a table, such as CustomerID in the Customers', 'table. Alternate key (or candidate key): a column other than the primary key that is unique. For example, an Employees table might store an employee ID and a social security number, both of which are unique. Foreign key: a column that refers to a unique column in another table, such as CustomerID in the Orders table, which refers to CustomerID in the Customers table. In a Data Model, the primary key or alternate key is referred to as the related column. If a table has both a primary and alternate key, you can use either one as the basis of a table relationship. The foreign key is referred to as the source column or just column. In our example, a relationship would be defined between CustomerID in the Orders table (the column) and CustomerID in the Customers table (the lookup column). If you import data from a relational database, by default Excel chooses the foreign key from one table and the corresponding primary key from the other table. However, you can use any column that has unique values for the lookup column. Types of relationships The relationship between a customer and an order is a one-to-many relationship. Every customer can have multiple orders, but an order can’t have multiple customers. Another important table relationship is one-to-one. In our example here, the CustomerDiscounts table, which defines a single discount rate for each customer, has a one-to-one relationship with the Customers table. This table shows the relationships between the three tables ( Customers, CustomerDiscounts , and Orders ): Relationship Type Lookup Column Column Customers-CustomerDiscounts one-to-one Customers.CustomerID CustomerDiscounts.CustomerID Customers-Orders one-to-many Customers.CustomerID Orders.CustomerID Note: Many-to-many relationships are not supported in a Data Model. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a direct relationship between Products and Customers, in which a customer can buy many products and the same product can be bought by many customers. Relationships and performance After any relationship has been created, Excel must typically recalculate any formulas that use columns from tables in the newly created relationship. Processing can take some time, depending on the amount of data and the complexity of the relationships. For more details, see Recalculate Formulas . Multiple relationships between tables A Data Model can have multiple relationships between two tables. To build accurate calculations, Excel needs a single path from one table to the next. Therefore, only one relationship between each pair of tables is active at a time. Though the others are inactive, you', 'can specify an inactive relationship in formulas and queries. In Diagram View, the active relationship is a solid line and the inactive ones are dashed lines. For example, in AdventureWorksDW2012, the table DimDate contains a column, DateKey , that is related to three different columns in the table FactInternetSales : OrderDate, DueDate , and ShipDate . If the active relationship is between DateKey and OrderDate, that is the default relationship in formulas unless you specify otherwise. Requirements for a table relationship A relationship can be created when the following requirements are met: Criteria Description Unique Identifier for Each Table Each table must have a single column that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This column is often referred to as the primary key. Unique Lookup Columns The data values in the lookup column must be unique. In other words, the column can’t contain duplicates. In a Data Model, nulls and empty strings are equivalent to a blank, which is a distinct data value. This means that you can’t have multiple nulls in the lookup column. Compatible Data Types The data types in the source column and lookup column must be compatible. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models . Unsupported database features in the Excel Data Model In a Data Model, you cannot create a table relationship if the key is a composite key. You’re also restricted to creating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Other relationship types are not supported. Composite Keys and Lookup Columns A composite key is composed of more than one column. Data Models can’t use composite keys: a table must always have exactly one column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. If you import tables that have an existing relationship based on a composite key, the Table Import Wizard in Power Pivot will ignore that relationship because it can’t be created in the model. To create a relationship between two tables that have multiple columns defining the primary and foreign keys, first combine the values to create a single key column before creating the relationship. You can do this before you import the data, or by creating a calculated column in the Data Model using the Power Pivot add-in. Many-to-Many Relationships A Data Model cannot have many-to-many relationships. You can’t simply add junction tables in the model. However, you can use DAX functions to model many-to-many relationships. Self-Joins and Loops Self-joins are not permitted in a Data Model. A self-join is a recursive relationship between a table', 'and itself. Self-joins are often used to define parent-child hierarchies. For example, you could join an Employees table to itself to produce a hierarchy that shows the management chain at a business. Excel does not allow loops to be created among relationships in a workbook. In other words, the following set of relationships is prohibited. Table 1, column a to Table 2, column f Table 2, column f to Table 3, column n Table 3, column n to Table 1, column a If you try to create a relationship that would result in a loop being created, an error is generated. Automatic detection and inference of relationships in Power Pivot One of the advantages to importing data using the Power Pivot add-in is that Power Pivot can sometimes detect relationships and create new relationships in the Data Model it creates in Excel. When you import multiple tables, Power Pivot automatically detects any existing relationships among the tables. Also, when you create a PivotTable, Power Pivot analyzes the data in the tables. It detects possible relationships that have not been defined, and suggests appropriate columns to include in those relationships. The detection algorithm uses statistical data about the values and metadata of columns to make inferences about the probability of relationships. Data types in all related columns should be compatible. For automatic detection, only whole number and text data types are supported. For more information about data types, see Data types supported in Data Models. For the relationship to be successfully detected, the number of unique keys in the lookup column must be greater than the values in the table on the many side. In other words, the key column on the many side of the relationship must not contain any values that are not in the key column of the lookup table. For example, suppose you have a table that lists products with their IDs (the lookup table) and a sales table that lists sales for each product (the many side of the relationship). If your sales records contain the ID of a product that does not have a corresponding ID in the Products table, the relationship can’t be automatically created, but you might be able to create it manually. To have Excel detect the relationship, you need to first update the Product lookup table with the IDs of the missing products. Make sure the name of the key column on the many side is similar to the name of the key column in the lookup table. The names do not need to be exactly the same. For example, in a business setting, you often have variations', \"on the names of columns that contain essentially the same data: Emp ID, EmployeeID, Employee ID, EMP_ID , and so on. The algorithm detects similar names and assigns a higher probability to those columns that have similar or exactly matching names. Therefore, to increase the probability of creating a relationship, you can try renaming the columns in the data that you import to something similar to columns in your existing tables. If Excel finds multiple possible relationships, then it does not create a relationship. This information might help you understand why not all relationships are detected, or how changes in metadata--such as field name and the data types--could improve the results of automatic relationship detection. For more information, see Troubleshoot Relationships . Automatic Detection for Named Sets Relationships are not automatically detected between Named Sets and related fields in a PivotTable. You can create these relationships manually. If you want to use automatic relationship detection, remove each Named Set and add the individual fields from the Named Set directly to the PivotTable. Inference of Relationships In some cases, relationships between tables are automatically chained. For example, if you create a relationship between the first two sets of tables below, a relationship is inferred to exist between the other two tables, and a relationship is automatically established. Products and Category -- created manually Category and SubCategory -- created manually Products and SubCategory -- relationship is inferred In order for relationships to be automatically chained, the relationships must go in one direction, as shown above. If the initial relationships were between, for example, Sales and Products, and Sales and Customers, a relationship is not inferred. This is because the relationship between Products and Customers is a many-to-many relationship. Need more help? Want more options?

Note: You do not need to follow this step if you open a new, blank database, but you will need to follow it whenever you need to add a table to the database. Double-click the first cell in the header row, and then type the name of the field in the sample table. By default, Access denotes blank fields in the header row with the text Add New Field , such as: Use the arrow keys to move to the next blank header cell, and then type the second field name. (You can also double-click the new cell.) Repeat this step for each field name. Enter the data in the sample table. As you enter the data, Access infers a data type for each field. Each field has a specific data type, such as Number, Text, or Date/Time. Setting data types helps ensure accurate data entry and also helps prevent mistakes, such as using a telephone number in a calculation. For these sample tables, allow Access to infer the data type, but be sure to review the data type that Access infers for each field. After you finish entering the data, click Save , or press CTRL+S. The Save As dialog box appears. In the Table Name box, type the name of the sample table, and then click OK . You use the name of each sample table (for example, Student Majors) because the queries in the procedure sections of this article also use those names. After you finish entering the sample data, you are ready to compare the two tables . Skip the following section (Create the sample worksheets), unless you want to learn how to create a worksheet that is based on the sample data from the tables in the preceding section. Create the sample worksheets Start your spreadsheet program, and create a new, blank file. If you use Excel, a new, blank workbook is created by default when you start the program. Copy the first sample table from the preceding section and paste it into the first worksheet, starting at the first cell. Be sure that you copy the header row, because it contains the field names of the sample table. Using the technique provided by your spreadsheet program, give the worksheet the same name as the sample table. For example, when you paste the Class Enrollments sample data, name the worksheet Class Enrollments. Repeat steps 2 and',\n",
       "   \"a product. A field: Contains data about one aspect of the table subject, such as first name or e-mail address. A field value: Each record has a field value. For example, Contoso, Ltd. or someone@example.com . Top of Page Table and field properties Tables and fields also have properties that you can set to control their characteristics or behavior. 1. Table properties 2. Field properties In an Access database, table properties are attributes of a table that affect the appearance or behavior of the table as a whole. Table properties are set in the table's property sheet, in Design view. For example, you can set a table's Default View property to specify how the table is displayed by default. A field property applies to a particular field in a table and defines one of the field's characteristics or an aspect of the field's behavior. You can set some field properties in Datasheet view. You can also set any field property in Design view by using the Field Properties pane. Data types Every field has a data type. A field's data type indicates the kind of data that the field stores, such as large amounts of text or attached files. A data type is a field property, but it differs from other field properties as follows: You set a field's data type in the table design grid, not in the Field Properties pane. A field's data type determines what other properties the field has. You must set a field's data type when you create the field. You can create a new field in Access by entering data in a new column in Datasheet view. When you create a field by entering data in Datasheet view, Access automatically assigns a data type for the field, based on the value that you enter. If no other data type is implied by your input, Access sets the data type to Text. If needed, you can change the data type by using the Ribbon. Examples of automatic data type detection The following table shows how automatic data type detection works in Datasheet view. If you enter: Access creates a field with a data type of: John Short Text http://www.contoso.com You can use any valid Internet protocol prefix. For example, http://, https://, and mailto: are valid prefixes.
